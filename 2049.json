By marking fret positions and using the LM386 audio amp, we've reduced the battery count down to one, and made it easier to find the right notes.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I find truly fascinating about this project is that we are directly converting an optical signal into an audio one. So not only does the type of material used to make the string affect the sound, but the color of the string does too.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"Weekend Project","flagid":"GUIDE_SPONSOR_RADIO_SHACK","text":"This project is part of RadioShack's The Great Create."}],"guideid":2049,"image":{"imageid":42679,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/itWIyE2KhZfvBdkC"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/acoaN4IIqNw?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>In this project we're going to take inspiration from Len Keeler's original <a href=\"\/Project\/Elastic+String+Bass\/35\/1\">Elastic String Bass<\/a>.
