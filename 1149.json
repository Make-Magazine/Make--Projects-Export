Wool yarns do not work well because they tend to felt up with all the washing, and the natural oils in the wool resist the dye, producing a very poor print.","text_raw":"Fiber content: Cyanotype does not print on all types of yarn equally, so be sure to test a small swatch before printing a large project.
