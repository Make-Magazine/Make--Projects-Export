If you make the first Orpheus Six-Shooter, please send me video (and I\u2019ll send you a soothing hand salve in return).<\/p>\n\n<p>My body design is simple, made from parts you hopefully have around the house, but the professional flash guns use a metal body that holds the battery and barrel both, making them much more easily concealed. Pro shooters also use a press-on clip instead of an alligator clip to attach power to the glo-plug. Either improvement could be rigged easily by a maker more clever than me.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Orpheus Shooter is just begging to be integrated into a leather glove or cane, as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>My next project for the Shooter: wiring it into a HobbyTron R\/C Apache helicopter for remote firing. Why bang on your ceiling to quiet the upstairs neighbors when you can fly a chopper into their window and set them aflame?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/13\">MAKE Volume 13<\/a>, page 88.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2118,"image":{"imageid":42195,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/VECgAxdBgdheEwhY"},"introduction":"<p>A stalwart of close-quarter magicians for years, the electronic flash gun is a simple device: a battery-powered, hand-held ignitor that uses a \u201cglo-plug\u201d to light a bit of flash paper and cotton, shooting a fireball a few feet into the air.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can buy one from most magic shops for around $50, but if you build one on your own, you\u2019ll not only save a few bucks, you\u2019ll also learn how easy it is to add fire effects to almost any electronics project.
