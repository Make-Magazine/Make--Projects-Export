With these resources, you should have no trouble creating your projects. And if you want some inspiration for coming up with ideas, the Scratch website also boasts more than 500,000 projects you can view and play online. To explore what others are doing with Scratch, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/channel\/recent\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/channel\/recent<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Scratch community lets you share your projects and comment on others. To join, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/signup\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/signup<\/a>. Sharing your project is as easy as clicking Share at the top of the Scratch window and then choosing \u201cShare this program online.\u201d If you like someone else\u2019s project, you can download and change it yourself, which is a great way to learn. But if you gain inspiration (or code) from other people\u2019s projects, make sure you credit them.<\/p>\n\n<p>For people to play your Scratch games directly, they need to have Scratch installed on their own machines. But there are also ways of converting Scratch projects into .exe executable files that will run on any Windows machine.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/21\/diykids_scratch\">http:\/\/makezine.com\/21\/diykids_scratch<\/a> for downloadable examples of user created games.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/21\">MAKE Volume 21<\/a>, page133.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1141,"image":{"imageid":22183,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/AJNnFaNRHYKqH5CR"},"introduction":"<p>The big video game companies create best-selling titles every year, but for the rest of us, bringing our own unique game ideas from wishful thinking into reality is notoriously difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>Creating even the simplest functionality can take tens of thousands of lines of code.
