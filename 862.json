Inspired by birds, RoboBrrd has a beak and wings that allow it to produce actions based on sensory inputs. The combination of multiple actions create behaviours for RoboBrrd to exhibit. These behaviours provide a way for fun and quirky interactions to occur between the robot and human.

In the robotics research world, the study of these aspects in robots is under the umbrella of social robotics. Social robotics explores concepts of how robots and humans can interact and understand each other on a more natural basis.<\/p>\n\n<p>We attempt to introduce three of these concepts with RoboBrrd:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>First, the appearance and initial understanding of expectations for the robot. RoboBrrd\u2019s bio-inspired design allows us to anthropomorphiz<wbr \/>e a familiar species. Humans will be able to recognize the key features, and create base expectations of what the robot may do.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Second, the robot communicating certain meaningful messages with behaviours to humans through its own movement\/output<wbr \/>. RoboBrrd allows us to use the degrees of freedom from the beak, wings, and stand to express different behaviours. The LED eyes serve as an indication for the current state of the robot, and can be adapted to illustrate its current mood based on its needs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Third, the robot understanding messages from the human.
