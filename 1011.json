Whether the picture is of baby\u2019s first steps or an Olympic gymnast\u2019s somersault, the process at work conveys motion in a static image. Stitching multiple images together is a form of time-lapse photography. In traditional time-lapse the output is a video. But here we\u2019ll place each frame on top of the other, allowing viewers to replay the action in their minds. Photo sequencing only works when the object moves across a static background. A dog performing a series of tricks at a show works well; a runner directly approaching the camera does not. Subjects can be anything from a bird in flight to a snowboarder\u2019s jump.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>It\u2019s very rewarding to create a picture that conveys more than what a single image can capture.
