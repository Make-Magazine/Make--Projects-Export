The image's resolution will clearly be limited by your computer screen's. On the other hand, you have great flexibility in terms of paper size, limited only by your screen size. Finally, if you have a darkroom readily available (I convert a bathroom into my darkroom in less than a minute) and the chemicals are ready the procedure is rather fast, 5-10 minutes, and not expensive.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"flicker.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/JKCEISkJQV1bhYo1.pdf","documentid":219}],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1429,"image":{"imageid":29543,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/vs4EnoTEMEZOQUy6"},"introduction":"<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/laptopogram.tumblr.com\/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">laptopogram<\/a> is a screenshot produced by exposing photosensitive paper (or even film) to your computer screen or other electronic display.
