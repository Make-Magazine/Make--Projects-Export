{"device":"Kids","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/Better+Nerf+Gun\/1816\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Simon Jansen","userid":10103},"categories":["Kids","Outdoors"],"conclusion":"<p>Using the pistol is simple. You pull back on the ring on the end of the plunger until the catch wire hooks onto the plunger catch. Then simply push the telescoping part of the plunger back into the pistol. (With a non-telescoping plunger, the pistol would have to be longer and wouldn\u2019t be as neat when cocked.) You\u2019re ready to fire!<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve found that when fired over a range of 8\u201310 meters (26\u201333 feet), the darts are fairly accurate and travel fairly flat. At farther distances, you need to start lifting the barrel to get more of a lob trajectory on the darts.<\/p>\n\n<p>What else could be done? You can paint the pistol any way you want, although I would stay away from black, so it isn\u2019t mistaken for a real weapon. Most parts of the pistol can be modified to suit your own particular tastes. The grip can be changed, the barrel length modified. Adding a stronger main spring is probably the best way to increase the range. You could also add some kind of sights \u2014 perhaps even a laser sight from a cheap laser pointer, for that high-tech touch.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next version I\u2019m planning is a Nerf-firing replica of a \u201creal\u201d prop weapon. Perhaps a stormtrooper\u2019s blaster from <em>Star Wars<\/em> or a pistol from <em>Blake\u2019s 7?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>'''This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/29\">MAKE Volume 29<\/a>, pages 112-122.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1816,"image":{"imageid":38656,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/4XZAmh3D1StTEJbl"},"introduction":"<p>Like most geek-filled offices, at my workplace we have several Nerf guns and similar toy weapons floating about.

Let your indoor combat foes tremble; with a little practice, one shot is all you need.<\/p>\n\n<p>I made the pistol from PVC pipe, aluminum extrusion, and aluminum tubing, with wood for the grip and various pieces of metal and plastic, mostly from my junk box \u2014 and you can easily adapt the design to use what you have in yours.
