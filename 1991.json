It works well and I can solder inside the house without bothering anyone or being exposed to the fumes.

If I were to do it all over again, I think I would buy more powerful fans, but I may retrofit those as well.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1991,"image":{"imageid":39995,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/2bAdL1NYFTYKgBZW"},"introduction":"<p>I do a lot of electronics projects and have recently taken an interest in stained glass.
