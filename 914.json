To do this, it transforms into a couch. The couch sways under the influence of light movements of your hands or by an electric actuator. As a result, all the internal organs are massaged. This therapeutic procedure is called Whole Body Periodic Acceleration (WBPA). It was developed by NIMS, founded by Martin Sackner. The company has developed a couch called the Exer-Rest costing several thousand dollars. I managed to create a similar effect with this device, which costs ten times less.<\/p>\n\n<p>Making the chair is easy: You buy a sheet of plywood at Home Depot along with several boards and planks. Home Depot will cut them to your size specifications. You will need to round off the corners of a few of the parts and buy screws, glue, twine, and cabinet hinges. Then you can begin to assemble the chair. All the materials will cost no more than $200.<\/p>\n\n<p>The chair can function even without the actuator.
