I\u2019ve already figured out how to use &quot;cage&quot; or &quot;lantern&quot; gears (Make Magazine, October 2010). For my next project I decided to explore making a wooden worm gear. I'll show you how I built it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I used a 1&quot;-diameter poplar dowel (a standard item at Home Depot and Furrow). I used SketchUp to draw the gear using an involute-gear program.  I used \u00bc&quot; birch plywood to cut the mating spur gear. It has 60 teeth and is 10&quot; in diameter.  You need two measurements to lay out the worm: 1) the &quot;pitch&quot;  is the tooth-to-tooth distance of the spur gear, about \u00bd&quot;. 2) The other measurement is the outside circumference of the cylinder from which the worm gear will be cut (3.14&quot;).<\/p>\n\n<p>To lay out the worm, draw a right triangle on a 17&quot; by 11&quot; piece of paper. For each circumference, go up one pitch.  You should end up with a long narrow triangle. Cut this out carefully and wrap it around a 6&quot; length of the dowel.  (Depending on how you wrap the screw, it will be left- or right-handed.) Using tacky glue, hot glue or tape, fasten the paper to the dowel.  I used a pencil to mark the edge of the paper.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, I used a small fine-tooth Japanese-style pull saw to cut a \u00bc&quot; groove all along the line.<\/p>\n\n<p>After getting the first cut done,  I carefully expanded the cut by cutting down from each side in a &quot;V&quot; pattern.  I finished up with a triangular file and sandpaper.  In the old days, large screws for wine- and cider presses were carved entirely using hammer and chisel.  Once the screw was cut, a tap was made from it, and that was used to make the nuts.  I plan to write another article about making wooden screws and nuts later.<\/p>\n\n<p>I used dowels and glue to attach all the parts.  The supports are recycled oak from a kitchen remodel project and a couple of other scraps.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Da Vinci worm gear works well. The worm gear offers a large mechanical advantage. Each full turn of the crank moves the gear wheel one tooth;  a 60-to-1 advantage.  I hope to utilize both worm and lantern gears in my next Da Vinci project.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Da Vinci used wooden gears in many of his mechanisms and drawings.
