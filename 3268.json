It shows in a practical way the superiority that super capacitors have over chemical batteries. What are the advantages that capacitors have over chemical batteries?  They last far longer, they can be charged much faster and they don't produce flammable or toxic gases.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a clear understanding behind how a capacitor can store electrical charge and thus electrical energy see the video <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/PAPGTuvHSRo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/PAPGTuvHSRo<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Will a capacitor someday replace a car's gas tank?  See the video <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/4tEYRjSIJaA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/4tEYRjSIJaA<\/a> for my view of this possibility.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"DrillingTemplate.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/LUmTSOstQ5BhPMbW.pdf","documentid":483}],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":3268,"image":{"imageid":57723,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/KJaOIYVyvYbnLO1i"},"introduction":"<p>No, this isn't a trick project.  It actually works.  Since the energy source for this flashlight is light and it works just fine at night, it must have a way of storing energy--and it does.  However, like commercial solar powered flashlights, which store chemical energy in batteries which then convert this chemical energy to electrical energy, this flashlight stores electrical energy directly in two one-farad super capacitors.  Today we use two 1-farad capacitors to store electrical energy to light an LED; tomorrow we will be using a bank of 10K farad capacitors to store electrical energy to power an automobile!<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qGLRfv2m1gg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>No, this isn't a trick project.
