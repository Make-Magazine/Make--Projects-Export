If you form a habit of doing a little bit at a time--say, whenever you empty the recycling--the work can become a pleasant distraction from, and maybe even a reason to look forward to, an otherwise boring chore.  And the finished shade makes a great Opus-style holiday or birthday gift:  &quot;Oh, just something I put together in my spare time...&quot;<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":898,"image":{"imageid":40415,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/xdLAw4d5tllZcnji"},"introduction":"<p><strong>Update<\/strong>:  Lots of folks have been asking about the fancy rainbow-colored shade in the new photo.
