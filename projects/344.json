{"device":"Computers","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/iPhone+Keyboard+Stand\/344\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Tnorth","userid":1765},"categories":["Computers","Wireless"],"conclusion":"<p>The resulting stand makes it considerably easier to type on your phone in meeting rooms, lecture halls, on your lap, etc. While building this, I realized it might be nice to add a handle to the top of the stand for easier carrying. This could be done by extending the length of the stand and cutting out an oval to create the handle. Additional Velcro could be added to attach the spacers to the back of the keyboard for easier carrying.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Here is my original description of the project on my website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northsecure.com\/iphone-stand\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.northsecure.com\/iphone-stand\/<\/a>)<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":344,"image":{"imageid":5641,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/NOWNDtP2IJIhVa2B"},"introduction":"<p>Frustrated by the fact that my almost-ten-year-old handspring visor and stowaway portable keyboard had better note-taking capabilities than my iPhone, I was pleased when Apple finally opened up Bluetooth keyboard accessibility on the iPhone.
