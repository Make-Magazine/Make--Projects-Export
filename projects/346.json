Turns out whatever coating they apply to make the plastic take inkjet ink tends to opaque the film, and after it's shrunk the effect is even stronger. Basically the &quot;clear&quot; film produces a dink with a translucent white background. Next time I will use regular opaque white film and include backgrounds in my designs.<\/p>\n\n<p>If your printer is capable of sufficiently accurate registration, it should be possible to print mirror images on either side of the film such that the resulting markers are double-sided. I don't know how well the ink on the reverse side will stand up to being face-down when shrinking, but my instinct is it shouldn't matter too much. You could put the same design on each side for aesthetics and\/or convenience, or you could put a different design on the reverse, perhaps an &quot;injured&quot; or &quot;battle-damaged&quot; version of the obverse unit.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"SeanRaganShrinkyDinkOGREminis.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/weFTuhC2qTm3WO6V.pdf","documentid":62}],"flags":[],"guideid":346,"image":{"imageid":5682,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/tKYZ3KG1umQJl6UR"},"introduction":"<p>Even as we approach the cultural apocalypse of ubiquitous, fully immersive, photo-real multiplayer video game environments, there are still those of us who like to play board or tabletop games.
