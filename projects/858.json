This means the artist is not limited only to the showy and colorful blooms of traditional Western florists.<\/p>\n\n<p>Monks from ancient times offered flowers at temples, and just as bonsai developed as a discipline, ikebana has also evolved. There are many styles, but the two most commonly seen are moribana and nageire. Moribana means \u201cpiled up,\u201d and this style is presented in low, shallow containers. Nageire arrangements, translated as \u201cthrown in,\u201d are made in tall vases. One basic premise of ikebana is the idea that the arrangement symbolizes heaven, mankind, and earth, each of which is represented by different elements in the arrangement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many rules govern the schools of ikebana, dictating the height of stems, types of containers, and even the angles at which stems can be placed.
