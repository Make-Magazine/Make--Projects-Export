Recording instruments on four discrete channels improves the sound quality and makes the master mix easy. The Zoom H2 has that (hidden) opportunity, because it can record sound from the 4 built-in microphones simultaneously. The only thing we need to do is to add 4 line input plugs and 2 switches. To change the sound level we solder some resistors and capacitors into the box. As reward for the modification you get a cheap multi-track field recorder in the palm of your hands.<\/p>\n\n<p>The video below shows how to get it done.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/X_iMatpa73Q?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>For a music band, synchronous 4-track sound recording is the absolute minimal setup.
