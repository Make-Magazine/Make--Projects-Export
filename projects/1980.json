It is tough but not particularly flexible.  I selected a woven nylon rope which is abrasion-resistant and very supple.<\/p>\n\n<p>After finishing the modification I stood the ladder upright and tested it.  Extending the ladder was almost effortless.  I've used it on numerous occasions since then and I'm very pleased with it.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1980,"image":{"imageid":39466,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/hhD2iIPbQTTdjPVJ"},"introduction":"<p>For me, a big drawback of extension ladders is that it usually takes a lot of effort to extend them to the desired height.  This is partly due to the way in which they are rigged.  Typically, the ladder is operated by a rope which is fastened to the bottom of the extending part of the ladder.  The rope runs through a pulley at the top of the stationary part and back down to ground level for the operator to grasp.  This simple arrangement is inexpensive to manufacture but it requires a force on the rope which is equal to the weight of the moving portion of the ladder.  If the ladder is large, or if the moving parts have a high degree of friction, the ladder can be very difficult to extend when it is standing upright.  This, in turn, makes it difficult to control the ladder and compromises safety.<\/p>\n\n<p>I recently obtained an old extension ladder for free.  Its rope was missing and while I was measuring it to find out how much rope I needed to buy it occurred to me that I could convert the ladder to a double-pulley system which would make it easier and safer to use.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>For me, a big drawback of extension ladders is that it usually takes a lot of effort to extend them to the desired height.
