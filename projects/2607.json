On a machine that isn\u2019t familiar with the device, your operating system may prompt you to hit a particular key so that it can identify the layout of what it thinks is a keyboard. In most cases, you can safely dismiss this dialog box and it won\u2019t bother you again.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you\u2019re writing and you\u2019re about to type your overused word, instead slam your hand down on the Awesome Button and it will key in a random synonym so that you don\u2019t have to worry about which one to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the word that pops up isn\u2019t working for you, you can easily delete it: tap Control-Shift-left arrow on a PC or Option-Shift-left arrow on a Mac to highlight the word and then hit Delete. You could program this key combination into the Awesome Button itself. Or modify the code so that if the button is held down for more than 1 second, it will delete the previous word! Or add a small panel-mount momentary switch to the side of the Awesome Button to do the same thing. Whatever you do, it'll be \u2026 fantastic!<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2607,"image":{"imageid":50954,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/l1ZRnOQfb1jwZREC"},"introduction":"<p>Ever since I started writing for MAKE, I\u2019ve kept an eye on all the awesome websites out there for awesome makers and the awesome projects that are posted every day.
