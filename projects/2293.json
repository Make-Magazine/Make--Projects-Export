We can usually go a day or two but things get out of hand beyond that.  The project is basically a timer that starts counting after each reset which corresponds to the last cleaning and displays the elapsed time on the LCD.  After 24 hours it triggers the sound machine to say &quot;Uh Oh!&quot; once an hour and start an LED flashing.  After 48 hours it triggers a falling missle sound effect every half hour.
