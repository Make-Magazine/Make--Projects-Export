You finished the brushless upgrade. Some quick notes about transmitter configuration:<\/p>\n\n<p>For the Mild kit, set your pitch travel adjust to L85 H85 and set your idle-up (stunt mode) throttle curves to a flat value between 68-75% as recommended by Dylan of <a href=\"http:\/\/astroid-designs.myshopify.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Astroid Designs<\/a>. From that reference point, you can adjust the throttle curve as well as pitch curves to your liking.<\/p>\n\n<p>The brushless motor and ESC require an arming sequence after you insert the LiPo. Simply flip off throttle hold, move the throttle stick up, then back down. You will hear a series of musical tones to indicate arming is complete. Go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/helifreak.com\/forumdisplay.php?f=321&amp;order=desc\" rel=\"nofollow\">HeliFreak brushless Nano subforum<\/a> if you need more help with this concept.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dylan compiled some BLHeli resources that can be found on <a href=\"http:\/\/astroid-designs.myshopify.com\/pages\/blheli-informaon-and-downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Technical Summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The XP-3A ESC in the kit comes preflashed with BLheli. It is preconfigured to run a Main Governor TX mode and motor signal input polarity is Negative.<\/p>\n\n<p>Main Governor P-Gain and Main Governor I-Gain are both set at x 2.00.
