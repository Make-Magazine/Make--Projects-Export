It is a very user-friendly material. You can mold it, stamp it, shape it, file it, carve it, glaze it, and texture it while it\u2019s in its clay-like form. After air-drying, the finished piece is fired either by a torch or in a kiln. During the firing process the binding medium burns off, leaving molecules of metal that have no choice but to fuse together. The finished product is a shiny sculpture of silver or gold!
