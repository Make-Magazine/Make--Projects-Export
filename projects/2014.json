In practice, this has not proved to be a problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>If it does, eventually, there's a variation of this mod that drills the hole in the battery pack slightly lower, and all the way through both sides.  The short machine bolt and nut is replaced with a 1.25&quot; #4 wood screw that goes all the way through the battery pack and engages the &quot;hidden&quot; case assembly screw hole under the bar-code in the controller main body.  A #4 screw passes cleanly between the batteries inside the battery holder, and is close enough in size to the factory case screw to effectively replace it.<\/p>\n\n<p>This more aggressive mod secures both clip and battery pack firmly to the controller main body, but requires removing the screw to change the batteries.  So far it has not proved to be necessary, and I don't expect that it will.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":2014,"image":{"imageid":40468,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/5SbitoPDhQXjgdGy"},"introduction":"<p>If you're playing Rocksmith (and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/2012\/03\/06\/rocksmith-ftw\/\">I think you should be<\/a>), and you're playing standing up (ditto), you have probably run into the &quot;where do I put the controller&quot; problem.
