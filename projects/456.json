I also added some wiggle to the edges of the original contact sheet too, since a machine-made edge would look weird next to my wiggly edge. Advanced mural makers may want to add a very gradual slant to the trunks, so that the trunk is thinner on top than on bottom, and alternating up and down to conserve contact paper.","text_raw":"Cut trunks.
