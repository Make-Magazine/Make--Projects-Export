Keep hands and feet clear when folding.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Ready\">Ready...<\/h3>\n\n<p>To move the catapult, fold the prop board up and twist the L-hook to keep it in place. Push the catapult to a location with at least 150' of open space to hurl, with no nearby vulnerable targets, such as people, pets, or vehicles. Place the prop board in the down position.<\/p>\n\n<p>Place up to 120lbs of weight on the counterpoise deck. (Two 60lb bags of concrete mix fit quite well.) If desired, attach two 18&quot; bungee cords to the deck and counterpoise. This will increase the machine\u2019s range and capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING:<\/strong> Don\u2019t trust the panic snap to hold the arm. Have a helper hold the arm while you latch it, and keep your head and other body parts out of the arm\u2019s arc at all times.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Aim\">Aim...<\/h3>\n\n<p>Point the catapult at the target. Pull the arm down. Latch the panic snap to the firing ring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Attach a rope or cord to a soft, lightweight test item (plastic dog toys are a good choice). Determining the optimum length of the sling is done through trial and error. Start with a sling length 1\/3 the length of the throwing arm and work from there. Be aware that too short a sling will hurl the projectile backward.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tie a nontightening loop in the free end of the sling (a bowline is perfect) and place the loop over the \u00bc&quot; bolt protruding from the pipe cap. Center the projectile on the center deck.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Fire\">Fire!<\/h3>\n\n<p>Make sure the area in front and in back of the catapult is clear. Step 8 or 9 paces to the side. Grasp the cord and pull smartly to release the panic snap. The throwing arm will rotate and hurl the projectile toward the target.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can optimize performance by making the sling longer or shorter, making the firing pin smoother or rougher, and adding or removing weight from the counterpoise.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Store_It\">Store It<\/h3>\n\n<p>The Folding Catapult is designed for easy storage. First, remove the weight from the counterpoise deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Loosen the turnbuckle on the throwing arm, then loosen and remove the pipe unions on the throwing arm pivot. Remove the throwing arm. Finally, unscrew the pivot assembly pipe stubs from the flanges on the uprights.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unscrew and remove the counterpoise assembly from the cross fitting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Loosen turnbuckles and remove the guy wires from the screw eyes, making sure to collect all loose S-hooks. Fold the uprights, and then fold the deck for storage.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/28\">MAKE Volume 28<\/a>, page 84.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2347,"image":{"imageid":46229,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/nAhpni2W2opQXRTM"},"introduction":"<p>I have long been enamored of catapults.
