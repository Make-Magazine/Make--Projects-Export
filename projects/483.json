Sure, I suppose I could only plug it in when I'm using it, but I'm kind of a neat freak about my entertainment center wiring and I don't want to be digging the Xbox out every time I decide I want guaranteed privacy.  Some kind of lens-cap arrangement seemed the easiest solution, and making it out of the foam that the Kinect itself came packed in avoids the danger of picking some material that might scratch the device or otherwise be incompatible with it over the long term.  Plus, it makes it easy for anyone who owns a Kinect (and still has the packing) to go and do likewise, should they be so inclined.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>My Kinect is a very cool toy, but it was not lost on me, as I was plugging it in, that I'd given the Microsoft hive-mind a pretty sophisticated set of eyes and ears straight into my living room.
