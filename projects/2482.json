And watch the LED: it will flash every time a beta particle or gamma ray hits the tube!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> The tube that comes with this kit is not sensitive to alpha particles. However, the kit is compatible with other tubes that do detect alpha.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mute:<\/strong> If you get tired of hearing the clicks, you can push the button S2 to mute the sound.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pulse connector:<\/strong> The pulse connector (J6) has the following pinout:<\/p>\n\n<p>1. VCC (nominally 3V)<\/p>\n\n<p>2. Pulse output \u2014 a short (100\u00b5s) active high pulse every time the Geiger tube fires<\/p>\n\n<p>3.

The serial header is set up to work with the common FTDI-232R-3V3 serial cable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data is sent over the serial port at 9600 baud, 8N1. The data is reported in comma separated value (CSV) format:<\/p>\n\n<p>CPS, #####, CPM, #####, uSv\/hr, ###.##, SLOW|FAST|INST<\/p>\n\n<p>There are three modes. Normally, the sample period is LONG_PERIOD (default 60 seconds). This is SLOW averaging mode. If the last 5 measured counts exceed a preset threshold, the sample period switches to SHORT_PERIOD seconds (default 5 seconds).  This is FAST mode, and is more responsive but less accurate. Finally, if CPS &gt; 255, we report CPS*60 and switch to INST mode, since we can't store data in the (8-bit) sample buffer.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":2482,"image":{"imageid":49146,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/pQf3JKFTURNVSkWe"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bsnkg45s5ag?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>Commercial Geiger counters can cost hundreds of dollars.
