It's the result of combining some very simple things into something entirely unique.<\/p>\n\n<p>It requires some basic wordworking, but nothing too advanced or difficult. It requires some basic electronics, but nothing too technical. It requires etching skills (OK; this part can be a bit tricky or dangerous). And lastly, it requires some art\/design skills.<\/p>\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":625,"image":{"imageid":10555,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/6nTIyYlgqlBdSNks"},"introduction":"<p><em>Take a picture<\/em> is a fine-art project by artists Brad Blucher and Kyle Clements. In the exhibit, the human eye see is only able to see blank surfaces (in our case, blank canvases). People walk up to the show space and see blank canvases hanging on the wall. They see absolutely nothing, then make some nasty comments: &quot;Those lazy, pretentious artists, thinking they can get away with doing absolutely nothing.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>What the audience is unable to see is the hidden maze of wires and circuits.
