At sea level, the flux is roughly one particle per palm size per second, which means San Franciscans sustain an astonishing 20 million hits through their bodies each day.

As a result, Mile Highers get hit at roughly twice that rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>These particles make their presence felt by ionization \u2014 that is, ripping electrons away from their atoms. Since atomic electrons are electrically charged, they interact with all other charged particles (e.g. other electrons, protons, helium nuclei, and so on), and so any of these, when sent screaming through space, becomes a type of ionizing radiation. In addition to charged particles, some photons, such as X-rays and gamma rays, also have enough oomph to whack electrons out of their atomic orbitals and so they, too, make the list.<\/p>\n\n<p>Much of the radiation around us comes from nuclei in the soil and the air that have too much energy to be stable; they shed their excess by expelling elementary particles. But most of the damaging corpuscles have their origins deep in outer space where pulsars, supernovae, and even stranger cosmic players accelerate elementary particles to fantastic energies and hurl them out into the cosmos.
