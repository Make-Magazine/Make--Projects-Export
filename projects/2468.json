{"device":"Arduino","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/Monkeysailor%27s+Photo+Lab\/2468\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Andrew Lewis","userid":107},"categories":["Arduino","Photography"],"conclusion":"<h3 id=\"Section_The_Big_Picture\">The Big Picture<\/h3>\n\n<p>I\u2019m very pleased with this project, and I now use it to process my rolls of film. The only problem so far is that the heaters take a long time to bring the bottles up to temperature, so I think I might replace the elements with 12V or 240V versions. This should be easy because it involves no modifications beyond exchanging the transistors for solid-state relays.<\/p>\n\n<p>The timer and auto agitator take all the stress out of processing film, and mean that I don\u2019t have to keep an eye on the clock. I can leave the film to process and trust that the tank will be stirred every few seconds.<\/p>\n\n<p>The processor is also handy for developing black and white film using weak solutions to achieve finer grain, which is a slow process. Experimental developers such as caffeine (yes, caffeine!) can take more than half an hour to process, and my Photo Lab machine lets me avoid a nasty hand cramp from manually stirring a tank for 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/31\">MAKE Volume 31<\/a>, page 123.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2468,"image":{"imageid":48130,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/2OXPqa5IU3LGKrvc"},"introduction":"<p>Traditional photography is fantastic. I love the way mechanical cameras feel in my hand, and I love the way film makes me think about composition and lighting before I actually take a shot. The only thing I don\u2019t like about traditional photography is the cost of having film processed or buying equipment to develop my own.<\/p>\n\n<p>To cut costs and have a little fun with an Arduino along the way, I decided to make my own film processor. The equipment needed to turn a roll of exposed medium-format color film into negatives actually isn\u2019t that complicated, and the chemical process is also straightforward<wbr \/>. Using a standard developing tank and chemicals, all you really need are a stable working temperature and accurate timing, which you can accomplish using an Arduino, an LM35 temperature sensor, and a few electrical components.<\/p>\n\n<p>To develop film, you immerse it in developer at a specific temperature for a specific amount of time, agitate it every few seconds to ensure an even process across the film, then repeat the process with fixer\/blix solution, and repeat again with rinse water. This can be done in a Paterson tank, which lets you pour liquids in and out without exposing the film inside to any light. With a film-changing bag to load the film into the tank, you don\u2019t need a darkroom!<\/p>\n\n<p>Different film types or chemicals require different times and temperatures, and the brightness, contrast, or color will not develop correctly if they\u2019re wrong. So I needed to work out a system that would maintain and monitor the temperature of 4 chemical bottles, and time the processing down to the second.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also thought it would be handy if my Photo Lab could agitate the film automatically, and store my time and temperature settings so I wouldn\u2019t have to reprogram them with each batch. For the auto-agitation, I used a hobby servomotor, and for programming I designed a control panel around a Hitachi HD44780 16\u00d72 LCD display, with pushbuttons for making menu selections. The buttons let you move through the menu screens, increase and decrease heater, timer, and agitation values, and save\/restore the settings to the Arduino.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the agitator, timer, and menu system,the Photo Lab project plans grew larger than my original idea for a chemical warmer, but I was confident I could make it all work.
