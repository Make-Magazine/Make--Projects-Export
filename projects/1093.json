These cameras let you display close-up shots with an LCD projector or external monitor, and they cost between $500 and $1,500. They\u2019re well suited to capturing images of document-sized objects, but come on, a grand for a glorified webcam?<\/p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all got streaming video on our smartphones now, so couldn\u2019t we just use that instead? The problem is, how to hold it over the project without a tripod to bump into.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hollywood grips solve this problem with what is known as a gobo arm, a lightweight mount that lets you position your smartphone (webcam, etc.) down where the action is without getting in the way. Commercial units run $100\u2013$150, not including the $30 clamp you attach it to. But for the price of one of those fancy clamps, you can piece together your own Mobile Document Camera Stand using easily sourced parts.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy. If you can make cuts with a hacksaw, you can build this project. There\u2019s also plenty of room for improvement.
