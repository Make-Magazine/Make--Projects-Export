The diameter of the detent hole drilled in the center of the dowel is an easy one to adjust; larger holes will tend to retain the ball longer and will decrease sensitivity.  Likewise, the center of gravity of the switch assembly can be adjusted by how far the dowel is inserted, or by adding weight to its base. Using a PVC cap or a couple that's flat on the end, instead of rounded, will give a rather more stable switch.
