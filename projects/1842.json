The closer the object, the greater the pressure. Sweep your hand around, and the device conveys to you a tactile image of your surroundings. I designed Tacit to help vision-impaired people navigate their environments, but it\u2019s also a fun and effective sensory enhancement for fully sighted people \u2014 especially in the dark.<\/p>\n\n<p>My first version of Tacit was a headband with vibration motors that ran faster when objects came closer. But this design had a distracting \u201cmad science\u201d look, and most obstacles, like furniture, are below head level. I also found that motors vibrating against your skull will quickly drive you insane.<\/p>\n\n<p>I realized that it was my own sighted prejudice to want to attach vision-simulating sensors to the head. The hand is more directable and useful, and putting a device on the back of the wrist leaves the fingers free.<\/p>\n\n<p>For rangefinders, I used two $30 ultrasonic sensors that detect objects up to 10' away, angled apart to take in a broader swath.
