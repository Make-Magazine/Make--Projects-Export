I was at this stage when the speaker passed around a demo of the newest training tool \u2014 a \u201cmagic story cube\u201d that pulls kids into the learning process.<\/p>\n\n<p>The speaker\u2019s words didn\u2019t grab my attention but the remarkable object in my hands sure did. This was cool. I had to make one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The magic photo cube (the easy half of a Yoshimoto Cube, a truly impressive object invented in 1971) is made by the clever hinging of 8 smaller, identical, and perfect cubic blocks. I had our local woodshop make 40 nearly identical cubic blocks from scrap. After mixing and matching I was able to make 4 magic photo cubes, each consisting of 8 blocks.<\/p>\n\n<p>The size of the cubic block doesn\u2019t make any difference for the project. The sides of mine are about 5cm, the perfect size for 48mm-wide clear packing tape.<\/p>\n\n<p>The magic is all in the hinges. Use strong, clear packing tape for hinges, taping the front and back of each joint. Rub the tape down with a \u201cbone\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s what my dad called whatever smooth steel thing he used to make tape stick \u2014 such as a socket out of the tool chest.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Sometimes something comes along that snaps you out of the blur of even the most mind-numbing meeting.
