What a great idea, but what about all the other devices I just pulled out of my pockets; where do they go? And, for that matter, how will all their batteries stay charged? I decided to make my own and started with some 9V motor wire bricks and a large baseplate. For my key chain, I drilled a small hole into a 2\u00d74 brick and then screwed a small screw eye into it. The whole system was cheap and easy to build, works great, and keeps my devices organized and charged.
