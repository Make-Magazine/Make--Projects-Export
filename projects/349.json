Wasn't Rosie the Robot supposed to help speed things along, to save us from tedious domestic duties? But here I've spent the last week laboring over the design of a tiny, yarn-made, non-animated robot, and I would have to do some sort of voodoo spell before I could ever get it to do the dishes or mop the floor. I shouldn't say &quot;labor,&quot; though. Designing the robot was fun. I got to use my bright silver yarn, and I got to decorate it with a whole bunch of sequins and beads. I also thought it should be listening to some good music, because there's no point in being made out of circuits and wires unless you have your very own, custom stereo system. So put on your favorite jams and enjoy crocheting this robot pattern that I wrote for you.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>A crocheted robot \u2013 what a hilarious contradiction!
