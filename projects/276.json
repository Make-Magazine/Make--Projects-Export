The Lily Pad pool warmer doesn\u2019t need to be removed to swim, sweep, or vacuum, and it meets new requirements in water conservation areas to keep at least half of a pool\u2019s surface covered.<\/p>\n\n<p>Best of all, the Lily Pad pool warmer can be made by anyone who\u2019s just a bit handy with tools. It\u2019s made of hula hoops, with black polyethylene film stretched over them to actually warm the water they come in contact with.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Attractive Solution<\/p>\n\n<p>The Lily Pad pool warmer uses black (low albedo) polyethylene film stretched over hula hoops. The film is in contact with the water, so it captures and transmits most of the sun\u2019s incoming radiation directly into the pool, warming the surface of the water. Calorimetric tests have shown that at high noon, a single Lily Pad will transmit more than 500 BTU per hour.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, this solution is highly attractive. Since it doesn\u2019t need to cover the entire pool, it gives the appearance of a dynamic sculpture as the pads nudge each other and form constantly varying patterns across the surface.<\/p>\n\n<p>To swim, it\u2019s not necessary to remove the pads. Half the pool area is open, and the bow wave ahead of a swimmer causes the pads to float aside. If you want to open the entire area for swimming, the pads can be removed in less than 5 minutes. And they can be seasonally stored in the boxes in which the hula hoops are shipped. My experience has shown that it\u2019s also not necessary to remove the pads for sweeping or vacuuming the pool.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/15034025?portrait=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s an easy way to warm your pool that\u2019s efficient, low-cost, safe, and actually enhances the beauty of the pool.
