Also keep in mind that precious metals are very expensive and currently rising in cost on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most jewelry foundries use silver to test designs before wasting expensive gold or platinum, and silver can be very affordable as the final material. Alternately, try titanium, copper, or bronze if you really want something unique.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/21\">MAKE Volume 21<\/a>, page 64.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1001,"image":{"imageid":20330,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/XIVaQcIwHNhGOVZD"},"introduction":"<p>After giving my wife a handmade plastic faux-diamond engagement ring, I decided I\u2019d better get serious and come up with more permanent wedding rings.
