I committed the third classic blunder and assumed that the nominal 1\/4&quot; plywood I bought at the hardware store was actually 1\/4&quot; thick.  It was actually quite a bit thinner, and I had to make up the difference at the bottom with aluminum sheet so that the 80\/20 rail, which is precisely 0.50&quot; thick, wouldn't stick out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Turns out true 1\/4&quot; plywood is very hard to find.  Fortunately, true 1\/4&quot; MDF is available from most hardware stores.  Take a gauge or micrometer with you to the store and check to make sure, before you buy.  If you don't have a micrometer, take the 80\/20 extrusion, itself, and verify that two of whatever you want to buy, stacked together, are just as thick.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":743,"image":{"imageid":12930,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/eJWrmU2bMKXQlqKW"},"introduction":"<p>This attachment mounts in place of your router's factory baseplate and is used for cutting circular disks from, or boring circular holes in, sheet stock.
