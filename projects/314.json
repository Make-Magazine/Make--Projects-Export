I just set the sink in place in the stand; it is not clipped in or otherwise secured.  The stand itself has a small amount of &quot;woggle,&quot; but instead of fretting too much over making everything rock-steady I just used a P-trap with a flexible joint.  At some point I may decide to secure the stand to the wall with conduit straps or by some other contrivance.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"PVC-sink-stand-plan.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/R1EsVteiOR1hBMNj.pdf","documentid":65}],"flags":[],"guideid":314,"image":{"imageid":5959,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/bhH2jAA3emYZvbTk"},"introduction":"<p>All the kitchen chemistry at my last place left the sink in no condition for human habitation, so I replaced it when I moved out, and took the old one with me.
