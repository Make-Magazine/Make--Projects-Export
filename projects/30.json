Why not make a machine that plays real drums? My Drumbot has the programmable flexibility and sequenced tight rhythm of a drum machine, while producing a more natural sound by striking actual drums (or boxes, or tabletops, or whatever). Building your own drum-playing robot is now affordable and easy, mostly due to advancements in programmable microcontroller<wbr \/>s and the shared knowledge of user communities. There are a few kits out there that\u2019ll do the job, but we\u2019ll be using Highly Liquid\u2019s MSA-R MIDI decoder kit. I enjoy this kit for its ease of assembly, low price, and solid operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The decoder we\u2019ll assemble will take incoming MIDI note data and translate it to control the opening and closing of 8 switches. Because the kit is preprogrammed and does all the heavy lifting, all we need to do is solder it together and attach a few switch-activated mechanical strikers to serve as our drummer\u2019s hands.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Digital drum machines can be easily programmed to play many different sounds and rhythms, but ultimately they sound a little canned.
