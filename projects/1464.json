I cut a 1 1\/2&quot; circle and looped 1 border then adhered to the top of the circle and then did the other 2 to create the pumkpin shape. For the top I cut 3 leaves using the Art Philosophy Cartridge as well and stamped them with the leaf stamp that comes with the Art Philosophy Collection from Close To My Heart. I used glue dots to adhere them to the top of the pumkin. The final step was using a strip of Kraft paper and rolling it on a pen then securing the shape I wanted with a glue dot and attaching with CTMH Liquid Glass to the top.
