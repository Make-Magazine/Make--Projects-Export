{"device":"Woodworking","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/Marble+Adding+Machine\/967\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Matthias Wandel ","userid":6009},"categories":["Woodworking","Retro Tech"],"conclusion":"<p><strong>Debugging<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Chances are, your machine will need a bit of debugging to get it working perfectly. Filing here and there will smooth the marbles\u2019 journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, the 20\u00b0 angle will keep marbles from getting ejected out the front of the machine, but if they do fall out, it may help to carve out the back edges of the holes that the marbles pass through. You can also just re-bevel the base to mount the machine at a 30\u00b0 angle instead of 20\u00b0.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Adding Value<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For maximum marble action, add 63 (111111 in binary) to 63.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also fun to use the adder for subtraction and negative numbers by using the two\u2019s complements of numbers. This means interpreting the leftmost bit as the positive or negative sign, and flipping all the other bits to convert from positive to negative. For our 6-bit adder, this gives a number range from \u201331 (100000) to 31 (011111). Adding \u20131 to \u20131 is the same operation as adding 63 to 63 above, and it results in 111110, the 6-bit two\u2019s-complement representation for \u20132.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, it\u2019s fun to subtract 1 from numbers, because nearly the same number results, but with all the original marbles dumped and replaced by new marbles.<\/p>\n\n<p>I invented my marble adder independently, but people have since emailed me about 2 educational games from the 1960s with which it shares some similarities, named Dr. Nim and Digi-Comp II.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiplying Possibilities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have spent time trying to come up with multiplier designs, but everything I\u2019ve thought of lacks the gee-whiz simplicity of the adder. I\u2019d want to multiply not by adding the number to itself N times, but by shifting the number to be added, and adding it to the other argument in each shifted position. Such a machine would no doubt involve a lot of sequencing and require gears and such, but I haven\u2019t come up with a specific design that has simple appeal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suggestions are welcome!<\/p>\n\n<p>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/20\">MAKE Volume 20<\/a>.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"How-it-adds-up.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/IXgiPgQWdYXEkymu.pdf","documentid":158},{"text":"Marble-adder-plans.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/q4vaAyvOoZOQxWKU.pdf","documentid":159}],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":967,"image":{"imageid":17257,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/YJ13EKolQSFVTasN"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GcDshWmhF4A?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>Computers add binary numbers constantly, but we never see how.
