Because of my chosen niche, I occasionally need a piece of hardware that\u2019s impossible to find in this country. Sometimes I ask friends in Japan to track it down.

In the past I would simply fire up a propane plumber\u2019s torch, hold each piece over it until it was glowing, and then hammer away. That was fine when a dozen nails were all I needed, but this time I knew I needed a more efficient way to heat all those nails, so I built a micro forge.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I am a woodworker by trade and spend my days building Japanese-style architectural elements and structures.
