Set the pedal resistance, then turn on the digital drum kit and start the click track.  Adjust the click tempo to 110 or 120 beats per minute to start.<\/p>\n\n<p>Start your workout timer, or just look at a nearby clock and note what time you want to stop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now operate the pedals in time to the click: Right, left, right, left, as if you were marching.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you're pedaling in time, start using your hands on the pads.  Do eighth notes on a cymbal with your right hand, and strike the snare drum every time your left foot goes down.  If you've ever played the drummer in Rock Band, you have the basic skills you need to start riffing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mess around with the different drumkits and sounds.  And always keep your feet moving in time to the beat.  Develop a pattern and work it until you can keep good time with it, hands and feet and click track altogether.  Then start embellishing, changing it up, and generally jamming out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before you know it, your workout will be over.  But you may not be ready to stop.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":1799,"image":{"imageid":37394,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/DFxdmJmcKEYJPX2X"},"introduction":"<p>A recent toe injury kept me from running for a few weeks, and I bought a stationary bike to keep in shape while recovering.  The exercise bike has a lot to recommend it:  it's low-impact, safe, easy to scale up for harder workouts, and indoors out of the weather.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also as boring as watching paint dry.<\/p>\n\n<p>I tried a lot of tricks to distract myself from staring at the clock while riding--reading, watching movies, playing video games.  None of it really worked, for me.  Then, one day I caught myself drumming on the handlebars in time to the movement of the pedals, and an idea occurred to me.  I bought a refurbished Yamaha DD55 tabletop digital drumset and mounted it in place of the bike's (fairly useless) readout panel.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the risk of hyperbole, the result has been almost miraculous.  Before, riding the bike was a chore and I would count down the minutes and seconds until I could stop; now, I am often taken by surprise when my workout timer goes off, and I'll actually keep riding for a few more minutes so I can finish working out whatever rhythm I am playing.  I look forward to riding the bike, and find myself jumping on it and riding when I feel restless or need to relax.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>A recent toe injury kept me from running for a few weeks, and I bought a stationary bike to keep in shape while recovering.
