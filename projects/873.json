Therefore, if you produce \u00bdlb of kitchen scraps a day you\u2019ll need 1lb of worms. There are about 500 worms in a pound.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Worms hate the light.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Ideally worms like the temperature to be between 55\u00b0\u201377\u00b0F (13\u00b0\u201325\u00b0C). However, they can tolerate 40\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 F. If they get too hot or cold, their activity slows down. Try not to kill your worms! Protect them from overheating (above 85\u00b0F in their box) or freezing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Worms need oxygen to live and they produce carbon dioxide. Your composter needs to be in a well-ventilated area.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Worm castings (worm poop) are toxic to your worms. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly harvest your compost.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Worms are great barometers. Before and during any low-pressure system such as a thunderstorm, worms like to crawl up and around the lid of the worm composter.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Redworm Life Cycle<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Worms can live less than a year if their environment is not ideal. However, Eisenia fetida (striped worms) can live as long as 4 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Worms are hermaphroditic but mating is still necessary. Worms mate anywhere in the box and at any time of year if moisture and temperature conditions are right.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before mating, a part of the worm called the clitellum, located about  of \u2153 the way down the body, will swell to form a cocoon filled with eggs. A worm\u2019s sex organs are very close to the clitellum.<\/p>\n\n<p>Worms mate by lying side-by-side with their heads in opposite directions, so that the sex organs line up with the clitellum. Sperm from each worm moves down a groove into the receiving pouches of the other worm.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the worms have separated, the clitellum secretes a substance called albumin. This material forms the cocoon in which the eggs are fertilized and baby worms hatch.<\/p>\n\n<p>Redworm cocoons are small and round. They change color during their development: white, then yellow, then brown, then finally, when new worms are ready to emerge, red.<\/p>\n\n<p>Incubation in the cocoon is between 32 and 73 days. Temperature and other conditions affect the development of the hatchlings. Although a cocoon might hold as many as 20 eggs, usually only 3 or 4 worms will emerge.<\/p>\n\n<p>The young hatchlings are whitish with a pink tinge, which shows their blood vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p>In about 8\u201310 weeks the baby worms will be mature and can begin reproducing. If conditions are good, a mature worm can make 2\u20133 cocoons per week for 6\u201312 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>More information about vermiculture can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/ciwmb.ca.gov\/organics\/worms\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/ciwmb.ca.gov\/organics\/worms<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/18\">MAKE Volume 18<\/a>, page 78.<\/em><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":873,"image":{"imageid":15415,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/PAEGyy3IDMlNqNhV"},"introduction":"<p>For three years I lived in a house with an outdoor composter.
