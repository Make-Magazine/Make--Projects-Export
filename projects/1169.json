I tear everything apart to see what I can make of it. I just got into small robots with the <a href=\"http:\/\/letsmakerobots.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">LetsMakeRobots.com<\/a> starter pack and some Basic Stamps and Arduinos. The Let's Make Robots kit is so complete you just stick it together with double-stick foam tape and it starts running around. I needed an analogue cable for the infrared rangefinder that came in the Let's Make Robots kit. I made my first one. I will show you how.<\/p>\n\n<p>I did not find any complete information on the analogue cable I needed. I found bits and pieces that lead me to the Arduino analogue and digital cables. They are not perfect, but they can be made to work if you know a little connector magic. The wires are not in the correct order and the JST connector is too big for the Sharp rangefinder\u2019s connector.<\/p>\n\n<p>I used to have a connector tool. It looks like a small screwdriver except it is a hollow tube and the front half is open. It works by slipping between the wire and the connector body; it blocks the locking tabs so you can get the connector out. Anything thin like a pin can block the locking tabs too. It does not take too much to play with connectors and make your ideas come together.
