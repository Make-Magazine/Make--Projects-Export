Together with other conspicuous valuables, a visible garage remote--say, clipped to the sun visor--can make the difference between a thief choosing to break into your car and choosing to move on to the next one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, you could just pop the remote in the glove compartment when you get out.
