There was no way I could cover that distance in the 10 seconds allotted by my camera\u2019s timer. So I stayed with the camera and sent my friend ahead to pose on the cliff alone. I was right, it was a great shot, but I was sorry we couldn\u2019t both be in it. This gave me the idea to create a camera remote with enough range to let me take more interesting, adventuresome shots than the standard timer or short-range remote would allow.
