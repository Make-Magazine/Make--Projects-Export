At your next dinner party, don\u2019t be surprised if your guests won\u2019t leave!<\/p>\n\n<p>This article teaches you the basics of upholstery, and our online supplement includes additional techniques for softening that slip seat (see <a href=\"http:\/\/craftzine.com\/07\/101\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/craftzine.com\/07\/101<\/a>). After this project you\u2019ll be ready to move on to an armchair or chair with a loose cushion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Upholstering with tacks is the most traditional method, and the least expensive for startup costs. You just need an upholsterer\u2019s brass tack hammer with a magnetic tip, and tacks. Any stapling described in this article can be accomplished with tacks. (Or you can use a pneumatic upholstery staple gun, which is easy on the wrists, fast, and gentle on the fabric.)<\/p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of gorgeous fabric, but it\u2019s not all that appropriate for upholstery. Upholstery fabric should be a weave, never a knit, and should have very little stretch along the grain. It should be sturdy enough to withstand having staples put in and ripped out.
