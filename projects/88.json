For one of them, I used foamcore board instead of plywood, which I covered with colored foil wrapping paper. I also covered the battery pack with a hemispherical spray-can lid, all of which gave the Gyrocar a flying-saucer look. I'd love to see your designs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts on Make: Online:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>DIY Electric Gyroscope<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/11\/diy_electric_gyroscope.html\" title=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/11\/diy_electric_gyroscope.html\">http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/11...<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Gyroscopes: Everything You Need to Know<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/03\/gyroscopes_everything_you.html\" title=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/03\/gyroscopes_everything_you.html\">http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2006\/03...<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/23\">MAKE Volume 23<\/a>, page 84.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"brackettemplate.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/PhUoQNftviBFRtVG.pdf","documentid":46}],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":88,"image":{"imageid":2350,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/bLttD6c66d4JiULd"},"introduction":"<p>Anyone who's played with a gyroscope toy powered by pulling a string wound around its axle knows that it's fascinating, but also frustrating because it runs down so quickly and has to be rewound.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/16076189?portrait=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>I decided to make an electric version that runs for as long as its AAA batteries hold out -- which can be at least a half-hour, since the spinning gyroscope wheel stores some energy, easing the load on the motor.<\/p>\n\n<p>I went through 3 iterations before arriving at this simple design, which is easy to build and works well.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to battery power, the Gyrocar has a small track wheel at the bottom that's friction-powered by the main gyroscope wheel.<\/p>\n\n<p>The track wheel drives the Gyrocar along any thin, horizontal edge while it bears the gyroscope's weight, but otherwise it doesn't press against the main wheel, to avoid draining energy.
