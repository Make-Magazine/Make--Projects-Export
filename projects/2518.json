Sounds of the wind in various places create low volume tones that we barely hear. They have a certain beauty and randomness to them that are unique to nature.  We've all heard the wind rustling the leaves, hitting our cars, and, even in its most raw form, moving up against our ears on the beach and in open fields, but have we ever really gotten a chance to hear what the wind would sound like if we analyzed it electronically?<\/p>\n\n<p>The  <a href=\"http:\/\/pwrhousepirates.tumblr.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Powerhouse Pirates<\/a> have done just that.  We modified a simple kite to hold an accelerometer and programmed an Arduino to play tones based on the accelerometer's input. The result is the SPEAKR!
