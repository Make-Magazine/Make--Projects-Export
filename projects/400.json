He couldn't remember the exact recipe, but knew it had molasses (although many recipes use Golden Syrup, which is not easily found in the U.S., or you can also substitute honey or agave or corn syrup). I looked at a bunch of recipes online. They all had roughly the same proportions, but I decided to go for the one with the most rolled oats and the most butter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fifteen minutes later I was staring at some tasty-looking granola. There was no way there was enough liquid to hold that batter together! I ended up doubling the butter and molasses (yum) and adding another half cup flour.

He looked them over and said, &quot;Well, usually they look a little more ... polished.
