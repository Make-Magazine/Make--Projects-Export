You\u2019re putting lots of pins into this thing, so be aware that thin fabric might tear. And fabric that\u2019s too thick is hard to work with. (I\u2019ve used a few denim jackets, which work pretty well, but polyester or a wool blend is easier.) Jackets with a lining are nice, because they allow you to hide the backs of the pins by pinning through only the top layer of fabric. Also, choose fabric with a simple pattern that won\u2019t overwhelm your pin design.","url":"http:\/\/make.dozuki.com\/Item\/Jacket","thumbnail":""},{"text":"safety pins","notes":"For this jacket I used sizes 0, 1, 2, and 3 steel and brass pins.","url":"http:\/\/make.dozuki.com\/Item\/safety_pins","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Pencil","notes":"or light-colored chalk.","url":"http:\/\/make.dozuki.com\/Item\/Pencil","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Needle and thread","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/make.dozuki.com\/Item\/Needle_and_thread","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Dressmaker&apos;s dummy","notes":"The dummy lets you see the overall effect of the image as you work.","url":"http:\/\/make.dozuki.com\/Item\/Dressmaker%27s_dummy","thumbnail":""}],"prereqs":[],"steps":[{"title":"Sketch.","lines":[{"text":"Choose an image for your jacket.
