To me, tinkering with electronics is the same as stitching a picture, and combined they can tell a story that crafters and gearheads both want to hear. This picture of a frog catching fireflies is embellished with lights that bring the bugs to life. Conductive thread is the magic ingredient, bridging the gap between rigid metal and soft floss. To make a stitched scene light up, combine traditional embroidery techniques with a few common electronics components. The possibilities are endless, and the result is an artful conversation piece.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2PFjuFa9ZvM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>This project has an associated <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.craftzine.com\/archive\/2008\/06\/electronic_embroidery_craft_vi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRAFT Video<\/a>.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I love any activity that promotes creativity and discovery.
