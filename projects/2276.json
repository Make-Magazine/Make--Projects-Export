Now show us how to make it better!<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of ideas:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Printable transparencies are a super handy way to make the sweep disks, and they work well enough, but if you experiment a bit, you will probably find that the black areas on a printed transparency still let a bit of light through from the LED.   Try covering the black parts of one of the disks with small pieces of electrical tape, which is <em>truly<\/em> opaque, and you'll be able to hear the difference: the tremolo effect gets stronger.  What might be a better way to make the disks?<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Wiring a potentiometer in series with a DC motor is a simple, cheap, and easy way to control the motor's speed, but it is not ideal.  Especially at the low speeds that produce better tremolo effects, a series potentiometer is inefficient.  We can get away with it because so little power is required to spin the disk, but the circuit could certainly be improved.  What might be a better way to control the motor's speed?<\/p>\n\n<p>We look forward to seeing what mods you come up with.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"Optical-Tremolo-Circuit-Diagra.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/YNKUDFcrKbcRim1f.pdf","documentid":399}],"flags":[{"title":"Weekend Project","flagid":"GUIDE_SPONSOR_RADIO_SHACK","text":"This project is part of RadioShack's The Great Create."}],"guideid":2276,"image":{"imageid":46185,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/gPPW1HVe1FZNRPSG"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/31pgOcLlCo0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>MAKE contributing editor Charles Platt proposed a &quot;Hypothetical Tremolo Wheel&quot; in his article about online DIY guitar stomp-box communities (<em>MAKE Volume 15, page 82, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.make-digital.com\/make\/vol15?pg=84&amp;u1=friend\" rel=\"nofollow\">&quot;Stomp Box Basics: Tremolo and Fuzz&quot;<\/a><\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, it's hypothetical no more.

So there's your electric guitar, and there's the amplifier it's plugged into, and there's the cable that runs between them.

The sound goes away. The charge can find its way home now, via the short, without ever bothering to go all the way through your amplifier. And so it does.<\/p>\n\n<p>What if you bridge the 2 wires with a resistor instead?  With a strong resistor, nothing happens \u2014 it's still easier for the charge to go through the amp. With a really weak resistor, the sound cuts out. With a resistor in the middle range, the sound will be quieted, but not completely muted, as the charge divides itself between short and signal pathways. Use a variable resistor, and you have a crude volume control: turn the resistance way up, the sound will be loud; turn it way down, the sound will vanish.<\/p>\n\n<p>And here's where Charles had a clever idea: use a resistor that responds to light. Wave your hand in front of the photoresistor, and the volume will respond to the shadow of your hand. Mount a spinning disk with alternating clear and opaque bands in front of it, and the volume will follow the pattern on the disk, repeating as it spins.
