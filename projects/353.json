Do not solder the photo resistors yet they will be covered in a different step!<\/p>\n\n<p>You will of course need a box or container to hold the circuit. I went to Dollarama and picked up a small box from the craft asile. The boxes them selves are made of pine and thus can be painted or cut very easily. Be sure to find a box that will house you're circuit, but still offer lots of space. I gave my box a coat of &quot;coffee&quot;  colored stain to make it look old; the color alone is totality up to you. After the paint or stain has dried drill four holes for the photo resistors, one for the switch, and a 1\/4&quot; hole on the side with the speaker. For the switch and photo resistors the hole size will vary by the size of your components. Ta-Da! You're box is complete! now all thats left to do is to stuff it with the circuit.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design is totally up to you. I just put all four in four separate corners. To do so you will have to use a drill bit that comes close to the size of your photo resistors. Then with the holes cut, place them in, and super glue them. Now solder the photo resistors as shown in the picture below. Now attach three wires, one to the left, one on the center two (the two photo resistor leads do get soldered together), and one to the right. Then lastly solder the other end of the wires to the correct pins as shown on the schematic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Simply take your completed circuit and all other components attached and drop it in. Then armed with super glue, secure any loose items. Where you drilled the 1\/4&quot; hole on the side earlier, center the speker over it and super glue it in place. Then Mount the completed circuit board in a spot where it can sit comfortably and allow the box to open and close fully. Once you found that spot use some hot glue or screws to secure it, repeat this for the battery pack as well. Close the box and flip the switch...<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see the sound the circuit makes will change when you wave your hand over the photo resistors or change the lighting in the room. Try different motions to produce different sounds, I observed that if you shake one hand really fast over one or two of the photo resistors the L.T. will give to a erie shaky sound. Or if you more your hand like a wave over one or all four photo resistors you'll get a wavy sound (no kidding!). Most of the sounds it produces sound like they are from a cheesy horror flick from the 60's or 70's! The total amount of sounds you can produce is only limited by your hands and lighting! Now sit down (well standing might be better) and enjoy!<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>The Light Theremin is a simple to build instrument that uses light and shadows to create sound.
