I don\u2019t, as a matter of course, can, pickle, bottle, or preserve much of anything.

The beauty of this method, however, is that aside from the very beginning, you\u2019re only using spent beans to make it (which feels delightfully frugal), and once you get the ball rolling, as long as you keep using vanilla beans in your kitchen, you\u2019ll have an unending supply of extract on hand, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, consider the fact that extract made this way keeps getting better and better with every bottle you produce.
