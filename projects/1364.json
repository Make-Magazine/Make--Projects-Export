Fill a tub, place it below the Bubblebot, and power it up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Watch how it works, and make adjustments by modifying the source code (speed and duration of arms spreading, number of spreading iterations), by raising or lowering the tub, or by setting up in different locations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tips for Happy Bubbling<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Pick a humid day, as cool as possible.<\/li><li>Avoid direct sunlight on the bubbles.<\/li><li>Pick places with steady wind flow or operate indoors. If you want to try for stronger wind, substitute a car fan for the computer fan, and experiment with different fan positions.<\/li><li>To focus the air more efficiently into the cord loop, add a paper duct in front of your fan. Just roll up and tape a piece of printer paper or cardstock about the same size as your fan\u2019s blade circumference, then tape this duct to the fan.<\/li><li>Decorate your Bubblebot! I added color to mine by slitting foam pool noodles along their length, about 2\/3 of the way deep, wrapping them around the sawhorse legs, and securing with zip ties. I cut and applied more noodle foam to other wood surfaces using hot glue. <\/li><\/ul>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1364,"image":{"imageid":27543,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/4xoMQWuNuDjHZHrn"},"introduction":"<p>When I read the Geekcon 2010 call for projects, I thought, what the hack \u2014 I\u2019ll do it.
