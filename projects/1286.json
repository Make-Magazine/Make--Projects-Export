The process involves using a presensitive copper board or a fiberglass board coated with copper and UV-sensitive photoresist, photoresist developer, copper etchant, and liquid tin. First, the presensitive copper board is exposed to UV light with a transparency of the circuit board on top. It is then developed leaving only the unexposed photoresist behind. Then, it is submerged in etchant until the copper not protected by the photoresist is removed. Last, the copper is protected from oxidation with tin.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>The whole procedure of etching a circuit board takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete.
