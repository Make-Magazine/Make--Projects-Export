Use crumpled paper and make a mound of charcoal in the center of the grill. For best flavor use binchotan (special Japanese high-carbon content, \u201cwhite\u201d charcoal) or mesquite and avoid chemical starters. Light the coals and let them burn until uniformly covered in white ash \u2014 about 30 minutes. Can\u2019t wait? Use your shop vac with the hose on the outlet as a blower to fan the flames. You\u2019ll have red-hot coals in just a few minutes, but be careful \u2014 don\u2019t blow hot embers all over, go easy!<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_MAKE_Recipe\">MAKE: Recipe<\/h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"Section_Yakitori_Chicken_on_Skewers\">Yakitori (Chicken on Skewers)<\/h4>\n\n<p><strong>Ingredients<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul><li>1lb boneless chicken thighs, with or without skin<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>\u00be cup mirin (sweet rice wine)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>\u00bd cup soy sauce<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>\u00bd cup sake<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>\u00bc cup sugar<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Skewers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>Combine mirin, soy sauce, sake, and sugar in a small pan and boil over medium heat until slightly thickened.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cut chicken into bite-size chunks or strips.
