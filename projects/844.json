{"device":"Retro Tech","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/The+Autophenakistoscope\/844\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Dan Rasmussen","userid":5679},"categories":["Retro Tech","Arduino"],"conclusion":"<p><strong>Time and motion studies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Just like the movies, the Autophenakistos<wbr \/>cope works best in low light. Dim the lights and plug it in. It first spins up the motor to half power, flashes the LED a few times, then starts reading inputs from the potentiometers. When the motor pot is turned all the way down, the motor should be off. When the strobe pot is all the way down, it should flash about once per second (1Hz).<\/p>\n\n<p>Adjust the motor and the flash frequency to a moderate level. Toggle the mode switch once or twice to figure out which is which \u2014 in automatic mode, the image should stabilize; in manual mode, it will wander or not be legible.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to experiment. Adjust the knobs and you\u2019ll see that multiple frequency combinations can produce smooth moving images. It\u2019s also possible to freeze the image by adjusting the rotational frequency to match the strobe frequency.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I first built this project, I noticed that the image can \u201croll\u201d just like it used to on the old black-and-white TV when I was a kid. It turns out that this is a completely analogous result.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another interesting experiment is to videotape the Autophenakistos<wbr \/>cope. You\u2019ll find that the frequencies of the strobe can coincide with the scanning frequency of your recorder. If you get it just right, the scope will appear to be dark in your video when it looks well-lit to your eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanical television<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I discovered the phenakistoscope while investigating mechanical television. Mechanical television is actually very simple, but impractical except for very small screens. The scan lines are generated with a perforated spinning disk known as a Nipkow disk.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the 1920s, television started with 24- or 32-line screens, and there were regular mechanical television broadcasts decades before Milton Berle showed his face in our (grandparents\u2019) living rooms.<\/p>\n\n<p>A 420-line spinning disk is another story; it would have to spin at very high frequencies to fully paint the screen at a rate that would satisfy the eye. But the Autophenakistos<wbr \/>cope would make a great platform for a modern, experimental mechanical television. I\u2019d also like to see it scaled up.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/20\">MAKE Volume 20<\/a>, page 100.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"AutoPhenakistoscope_supplement.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/KsxYqNv325EOwMuF.pdf","documentid":135},{"text":"CrocoChair_DiskImage_optimized.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/NhYVLcvYKwZJVjpB.pdf","documentid":136},{"text":"Autophenakistoscope_source_cod.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/TFQOJEMIwujvyqmm.pdf","documentid":137},{"text":"Autophenakistoscope_how_it_wor.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/3LPJ4ZQLLIePZhqv.pdf","documentid":138}],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":844,"image":{"imageid":14757,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/1rvt3cicQS3gWKNw"},"introduction":"<p>Motorize a phenakistoscope<wbr \/>, a 19th-century parlor novelty that preceded motion pictures, and keep its frames synched to an LED strobe by using a sensor and an Arduino microcontroller<wbr \/>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Invented in 1832 by Joseph Plateau, this device creates a moving picture from a sequence of stills arranged on a spinning disk and viewed through strategically cut slits.
