Have you imagined the scene that an air swimmer flying in the office or in your house?This is really funny.Last week I got a flying shark, the cute design and the funny move really bring me lots of fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>The air swimmers are really a giant guy, when it is filled up with helium, it measures about 57 inches long and 36 inches tall. Flying such a big guy, the feeling is fairly exciting. It is made of a durable nylon material so no crash will happen to it for the Shark just bounces off walls and other objects without damage. So, it is unnecessary to worry about improper operation to lead damage to the air swimmer. But, to follow the detailed instruction that comes with the air swimmers are necessary in case of unnecessary damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>How does it work? It's simple, four AAA batteries powered motor attaches to a small plastic pod on the bottom of the shark, and the accompanying controller controls the tail rudder's speed and navigation.The radio controller is quite sensitive so that you can fly the shark as your will. Before flying the shark, you need to assemble the shark fully according to the instruction. Then fill it up with helium, if you get no helium canister, you can take the shark to a Helium supplier (party shops, florists). After it has been inflated, you can fly it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I fly the shark in a small house and, to my surprise, it can turn around just in the small corner!
