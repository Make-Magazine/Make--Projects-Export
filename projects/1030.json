{"device":"Gadgets","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/ESP-psi+Testing+Lamp\/1030\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"John Iovine","userid":6785},"categories":["Gadgets","Science Projects"],"conclusion":"<h3 id=\"Section_Applications_Radioactivity_and_Party_Games\">Applications \u2014 Radioactivity and Party Games<\/h3>\n\n<p>True random numbers are useful for data encryption, statistical mechanics, probability, gaming, neural networks, and disorder systems, to name a few. Here are some specific applications for the ESP Lamp.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mood Lamp<\/strong> The lamp\u2019s output is unpredictable in both time and color. You can see it as a sophisticated mood lamp, a window into the ramblings of the universe at large, or maybe an example of God talking (if anyone is listening).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Radioactive Fallout Detector<\/strong> Excessive radiation, such as from radioactive fallout, would make the LEDs blink rapidly. Using this same principle, if you wanted to generate random numbers more rapidly than the lamp typically outputs, you could hold a small piece of uranium ore close to the Geiger tube. This will also cause the lamp to blink rapidly and output random numbers.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Precognition Testing<\/strong> Predict the color of the next LED that will light, and track the results. For example, write down what you think the next 60 LED colors will be. Chance alone will average 15 correct hits out of 60 calls, but any number of hits between 9 and 21 hits (2 standard deviations from chance) is not considered significant. Hit counts above (or below) this range may be showing ESP\/psi activity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Psychokinesis (PK)\/Intention Testing<\/strong> Choose a single color to \u201cintend\u201d and write down the next 60 LED colors while mentally trying to get your color to come out. As with precog testing, anything above or below the range 9 to 21 suggests activity. It has been suggested that groups of people all intending the same color have a higher influence rate than individuals, so this could be a game to try at your next party.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Telepathy Testing<\/strong> Two people sit in separate rooms; a sender observes the ESP Lamp and tries to transmit the color changes to the receiver as they occur. The receiver tries to receive the impression from the transmitter and writes down the colors and times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Telephone to God<\/strong> Use the ESP Lamp as a Magic 8-Ball type of device. Assign values to the colors, like green for yes, red for no, and so on. Ask a question and wait for the reply from the next lit LED. Matthew 10:29 reads, \u201cNot even a sparrow falls to earth without God\u2019s knowing it.\u201d If so, God would know of this telephone and could communicate through it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Global Consciousness Signal<\/strong> The Global  Consciousness Project (see Resources) analyzes randomly generated numbers for significant deviations from randomness, which they reportedly observed during Lady Diana\u2019s funeral and after the 9\/11 attacks. The ESP Lamp has a TTL output that can be read by a PC, so software can be written to check whether its output becomes less random, signaling an event, global or local.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Resources\">Resources<\/h3>\n\n<p>Here are 3 research sites that use statistical tools and random events to assess possible ESP\/psi abilities of the human mind:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Psi Arcade: An online intuition game from the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) psiarcade.com<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Global Consciousness Project: Featured in MAKE, Volume 09, page 62 noosphere.princ<wbr \/>eton.edu<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL): Extending the discontinued Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) program icrl.org<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/21\">MAKE Volume 21<\/a>, page 115.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1030,"image":{"imageid":19253,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/ULNJXcivlNyHkRXA"},"introduction":"<p>Albert Einstein once wrote that God does not play dice with the universe.

At the heart of the device is a mini Geiger counter that detects ionizing radiation from 3 main sources: cosmic radiation from the sun and stars; terrestrial radiation from radioactive elements in the soil, air, and water; and radioactive isotopes in living organisms\u2019 bodies, such as potassium-40, carbon-14, and lead-210.<\/p>\n\n<p>To produce the random numbers, a microcontroller constantly runs through a loop counting from 1 to 4. Whenever the Geiger counter detects a particle, the loop is interrupted and the last number counted indexes to one of the 4 LED cubes.
