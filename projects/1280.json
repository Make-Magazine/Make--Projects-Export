It\u2019s usually too acidic, and the ice melts immediately in the hot brew, making it weak and watery. I like my coffee strong and smooth, and have always resorted to espresso drinks. Until, that is, the day I stumbled into a caf\u00e9 in Maui that proudly served cold-brewed iced \u201cToddies.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>A Toddy (named after Todd Simpson, who invented his cold-brew coffee machine in 1964) is coffee that\u2019s been brewed without heat for at least 12 hours. The result is an amazingly smooth, strong, and naturally sweet cup of java without any acidic harshness or bitterness. Although it would be easy to buy the Toddy machine (around $35), here\u2019s a low-tech way to cold-brew coffee that\u2019s every bit as good as the black gold I discovered in Hawaii.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following method makes a very concentrated coffee. I happen to like it straight, but drinking more than half a glass sends me flying through the roof (unless, of course, it\u2019s decaf). It\u2019s all a matter of taste, however, and most people seem to prefer diluting this concentrated brew to 1 part coffee, 1 part water, and then pouring it over ice. For an iced latte, keep it concentrated, pour approximately 1\u20444 cup into a tall glass over ice, then fill the rest up with cold milk.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Until last year, I avoided iced coffee.
