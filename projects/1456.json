Transistors are easy to work with, requiring just a few basic steps. In most cases you need to use biasing resistors to control when they turn on and off. Biasing resistors also lower the current needed to switch a transistor on and off. Biasing keeps a transistor in one of its states so it only changes states when you want it to.
