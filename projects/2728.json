Your mattress will always feel like new. This mattress will never sag or lose its original shape.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use regular fitted sheets with this mattress. To create a pan to catch any broken hulls that could (and will) escape the weave of the fabric, simply invert an extra fitted sheet under your mattress and then put your regular fitted sheet on the regular way.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have been sleeping on a softer, foam mattress for a long time, this mattress may be an adjustment. Once you are used to the difference you may have a hard time sleeping anywhere else. Shift your hips, shoulders and legs to allow your body sink slightly<\/p>\n\n<p>into the hulls. You will find using a thinner pillow will be more comfortable on a hull filled mattress.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will want to  protect your mattress from sharp objects or jewelry that may accidentally catch and pull the fabric. If you ever get a small hole, it will repair very easily with a few hand stitches or simply order additional fabric.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2728,"image":{"imageid":51974,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/eXnM5DJ3GSBNFsLN"},"introduction":"<p>OpenYourEyesBed<wbr \/>ding.com is a resource for all your DIY mattress materials.
