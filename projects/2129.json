The Lumia boxes have enough room to mount 2 colored lasers, following slightly different paths to create superimposed pattern projections.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Lumia projector Wayne built (shown here, minus the wheel) has red and green lasers both cooking away. Note the cooling fan and heat sink on the top laser, a 20mW greenie. The mirror is secured with a cabinet door hinge and a strip of pipe strap.<\/p>\n\n<p>The motor has a more elegant mounting method: standoffs made for circuit board support. He also used \u00bc&quot; masonite for his base. Having a better stock of sheet metal than I, Wayne used brass strips and small angle brackets for his laser supports. The blue material around the edge is designed to cushion the apparatus in transit, and the copper strip at the top secures the base plate to the box.<\/p>\n\n<p>RESOURCES<\/p>\n\n<p>A good place to start: laserpointerfor<wbr \/>ums.com<\/p>\n\n<p>For advanced users and professional laserists: photonlexicon.c<wbr \/>om\/forums<\/p>\n\n<p>The pioneering work of Thomas Wilfred: lumia-wilfred.org<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit makezine.com\/20<wbr \/>\/lunchboxen for hobby laser and materials buying advice and photos of the laser lunchboxen in action.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project first appeared in MAKE Volume 20, page 110.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"uVPTiT1l3jAgCOPS.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/gtNSXYmkJOpXaiuE.pdf","documentid":272},{"text":"p2oE4WwuZbhs3efU.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/G1riwI2QHONtIiJj.pdf","documentid":273}],"flags":[],"guideid":2129,"image":{"imageid":42299,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/MLnmqNpNTRjtISff"},"introduction":"<p>Back in the 1970s, my friend Wayne Gillis and I used to do light shows at science fiction conventions.
