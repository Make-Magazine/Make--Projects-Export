This mixture of oil, ash and water, so goes the tale, had its effect on the local populace, for whom cleanliness came noticeably easily when bathing in the current downstream of the sacrifice site. Other centers of soap origin may have existed \u2013 but regardless of who first saw the chemical reaction in action and of how the knowledge spread through the world, we can safely assume this: By observation of nature, people learned to recreate the chemistry of water, potash and oil, thereby producing the first liquid soaps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Subsequently, standards of cleanliness grew and spurred the rise of industries.
