The LEDs will attach to the heatsink, and the heatsink to the fan.  Notice that if you have a 24V fan, you will need some extra batteries.  Since most fans are 12V, this shouldn't be a problem, but as mine was 24V, I had to use 2 additional small batteries.  Ignore them if you have a 12V fan.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2399,"image":{"imageid":48201,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/iRITnFnTF4SXNEfw"},"introduction":"<p>This project is fairly simple, but should use a fairly large housing for good airflow.
