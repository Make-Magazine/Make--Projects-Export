Before hauling the old one to the dump I figured I would try to convert it into a spray paint booth.  My at-the-time booth was a cardboard box, with an old cookie sheet, sitting over a large trash can and it did not do well containing overspray.  I was desperate for something better and thought I would give this project a chance.  My plans included lighting and constructing a lazy Susan platform.  I opted out of adding a ventilation system as my usage would be with non-toxic vapors.  If you decide to build something similar, and will be using paints with toxic vapors, for safety reasons please install some sort of ventilation system.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Many years ago I replaced my dead dishwasher with a new one.
