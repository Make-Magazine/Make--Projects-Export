Though it works well enough as described, there's plenty of room for improvement of its handling qualities.  Adding egg whites or other thickener, for instance, might improve the handling qualities and\/or reduce the tendency of the ink to diffuse along grain lines.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is, moreover, no reason this material has to be applied with a stamp.  It might also be applied with a stencil, a marker, a brush, a printer, or some other means, and each of these might have interesting applications and\/or merit adjustments to the properties of the ink itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other substrates might also be tested.
