What I should've done, in retrospect, is take before and after photos showing the cord hanging freely in space.  This would clearly have demonstrated that the &quot;after&quot; coil is noticeably tighter, because it doesn't stretch nearly as far when hanging freely.  Alas, I didn't get the necessary &quot;before&quot; photo, so you'll have to take my word for it.  But if you do decide to try this for yourself, don't repeat my mistake:  get that shot!  And then share it with the rest of us!
