Long before Rit came in packets, color was everywhere. Beautiful colors were produced from plants, wood scraps, mud, shellfish, and even bugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>My friends and I once spent an entire summer experimenting with natural dyes. It was a fun way to bring more color into our lives; it\u2019s sure to be the same for you. Many natural sources of dye are still available today and are simple to use. In this tutorial, I\u2019ll show you how to dye wool using the ubiquitous onionskin.
