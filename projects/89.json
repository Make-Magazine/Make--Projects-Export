Our household of 5 adults does about 6 or 7 loads of laundry per week. At roughly 40 gallons per, that\u2019s 260 gallons saved. And it\u2019s energy saved as well; around 20% of the energy used in California is related to water use \u2014 pumping, treating, disposing, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, the type of system I built was originally described (although perhaps not designed) by Art Ludwig of Santa Barbara, Calif. He calls this type of system a &quot;branched drain to mini-leach \ufb01eld system&quot; and describes it in detail in his book <em>Create an Oasis with Greywater<\/em>, which is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oasisdesign.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">oasisdesign.net<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: This project first appeared in MAKE Volume 13, page 151.<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/13\">http:\/\/makezine.com\/13<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts on Make: Online:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Make Your Own Trash Bag Holder<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03\/make_your_own_trash_bag_holder.html\" title=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03\/make_your_own_trash_bag_holder.html\">http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03...<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Flashback: Easy Backyard Graywater System<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03\/flashback_easy_backyard_graywater_s.html\" title=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03\/flashback_easy_backyard_graywater_s.html\">http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2009\/03...<\/a><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":89,"image":{"imageid":2252,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/xZHUyGfPpN4DeKUl"},"introduction":"<p>The typical American household sends the water it's bathed, brushed its teeth, and cleaned its clothes with, called graywater, to the municipal waste facility. Then it waters its lawns and gardens with more fresh water, wasting about 1,000 gallons per month. But you can safely use graywater for irrigation if it's handled by a proper recycling system, and if you use biodegradable detergent and don't wash diapers.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an avid gardener living in dry California, I wanted a simple and inexpensive way to reuse water to keep my garden green and healthy. In 2004, my wife and I had to retrofit our house's basement, so I moved the laundry machines to the back carport, which is at a slightly higher elevation than our adjacent garden and far from a sewer connection. This was my opportunity. At first, I simply let waste water from the washer run into a 3&quot; flexible corrugated pipe, which I moved around to drain near any plants that I wanted to water.
