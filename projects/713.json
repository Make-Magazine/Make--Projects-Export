Bundle up some kindling into a small ball and flatten it out.  Keep the kindling loose. Bits of brush work well, and I generally use shaved bark.

If using a magnesium fire-starter, make sure you aim at the char cloth when you strike the magnesium rod with the knife or blade on your leatherman tool.","text_raw":"How to light your char cloth: You just need a small flame or a spark.
