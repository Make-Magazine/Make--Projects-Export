Once, I happened upon a smaller cake stand, perfect for showcasing a single cupcake, and danced it home, where I discovered that even <em>that<\/em> little stand had no place to settle. I thought, if only I could find an even <em>smaller<\/em> cake stand, perhaps I could find a spot for it and its sweet (if only temporary) tenant. I never did find a smaller stand, but instead, I dreamed up this nifty project using vintage wooden spools of thread and round wooden drink coasters. I think these sweet stands are quite perfect for a mad tea party that features a variety of itty-bitty scrumptious treats.
