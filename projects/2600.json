Either one will work perfectly for this project. I chose to use almond paste because it tends to have flecks of color in it from the skins of the almonds, while the candy dough of marzipan is more often pure white. I wanted the flecks because I think it lends some extra realism to the final pumpkin. Use the decorations on cakes, or just serve them as their own yummy treats.
