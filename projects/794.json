What you\u2019ll be learning here is good ol\u2019 basic embroidery, the type that Jenny Hart of Sublime Stitching has made so hip and cool. Once you know the basics, try experimenting with different types of threads, stitches, and fabrics. I think of embroidering like painting \u2014 your floss is the paint and your fabric is the canvas. You can illustrate many beautiful things with just a few stitches under your belt.<\/p>\n\n<p>Embroidery is very easy. All you need is a needle, floss, an embroidery hoop, your imagination, and some material. It\u2019s also very portable, so you can do it during your commute, hanging out with your friends, or in front of the TV. If you\u2019re just starting out, your design should be a simple line drawing, or you can use a heat-transferred embroidery design, available for purchase.
