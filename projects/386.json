Run a current through it and it glows red hot. Until the mid '60s rocket motors came with a length of the wire, which rocketeers cut and shaped into an igniter. If placed correctly they are very reliable. I enhanced the austere original design with a few tricks picked up from old newsletters and personal experience.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nichrome igniters can only be used with black powder motors, and have one other drawback: they need a lot of current to work. This isn't a problem if you're using a 12V launch system powered by a car battery.
