Then I started seeing them everywhere — at every auto body shop and every metal gate installer; even hooked up to a generator at drag races.</p>\n\n<p>Having used a Lincoln 135 Plus wire-feed welder (about $600) for a month or two, I’m not scoffing any longer. Granted, it is not structural. You can’t weld a bridge, skyscraper, or engine mounts to a car frame. But you can weld steel up to 3/16ths, which is thick enough to make furniture, wrought iron gates, and bad art.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of the small Lincoln welders is they are light and portable. And when you get to wherever you are going, you can plug them into a standard 110-volt 20-amp outlet. If you use the flux core kit, you don’t even have to carry around a tank of compressed shielding gas.</p>\n\n<p>This article is not a replacement for the manual or the many excellent books devoted to welding. This is a primer to explain the process and show how you can be a welder by the end of the weekend.</p>",
