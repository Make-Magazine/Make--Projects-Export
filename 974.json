One knob controls the sound generated, the other controls the tempo of the loop, and the button writes the current sound into the ongoing loop. The variety of sounds you can get from these three controls is amazing.<\/p>\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need any special or expensive tools to build the Luna Mod, and it was designed for hackability.
