When you are thinking on the last option, I have a very simple method. You can use a 12-volt electric blanket. The only thing you need to do is to make a slit in the center of the blanket to put your head through, and sew a collar around the hole with a strip of contrasting cloth. Take care with the direction of the heating wires inside the blanket.  To close both sides, use Velcro. You can carry the battery in a small backpack. With a 12-volt lead (gel) battery of 12AH you can be warm for some time depending on the heating level you set.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uA2rn9o0BoU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>What is better, heating a room or heating yourself?
