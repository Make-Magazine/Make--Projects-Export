That\u2019s why it\u2019s called additive manufacturing. You send the printer a computer file that\u2019s a 3D model of something \u2014 an iPod case, a bike part, your head \u2014 then it prints out the object for you. These machines are becoming affordable for schools, labs, libraries, and families, and there\u2019s lots of software out there for creating 3D files to print.<\/p>\n\n<p>We chose Autodesk 123D software for this project because it\u2019s free, a lot of it is web-based so you can use it from any computer, and amazingly, it lets you create a 3D model directly from digital photos. That way, you can do it all from home, and you don\u2019t have to go get yourself scanned by a laser scanner.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you\u2019re done making your 3D model, you can take it to a makerspace where they have a 3D printer, or you can send it out to a service and they\u2019ll print it and mail it right to your home.
