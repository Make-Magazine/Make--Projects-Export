Most commercially dyed wool is done so with chemical or acid dyes, since natural dyeing is more variable, and requires quite a lot of plant materials to dye on a commercial scale. Whenever dyeing at home, it is advisable to always research the materials you are working with - plants can be poisonous! Find out how they react when boiled, and if you're foraging for materials, how much of one plant you can take from an area without damaging the surrounding environment. For the most part, it's a lot of fun!
