Without a control, however, I'm just speculating.  I can say, for certain, that the foamed-in anchors <em>feel<\/em> more solid than the anchors without foam.  Tap on the door where it's without foam and it goes <em>bong<\/em>, whereas if it's been foamed it just goes <em>thud<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The foam makes a bit of a mess, however, and if too vigorously applied can cause the surface of the door to bow out annoyingly.  So whether or not it's really worth doing is still an open question in my mind.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":254,"image":{"imageid":4647,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/JfG1T4SyCx4tyXqH"},"introduction":"<p>The thing about folding tables is, the tops--which are commonly made of cheap particle board--tend to wear out much faster than the legs--which are usually made of steel.
