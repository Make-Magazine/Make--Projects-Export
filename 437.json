Manganese dioxide is present as a catalyst, meaning it is neither consumed nor created during the course of the reaction, and is added only to accelerate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. That means it can be preserved and reused indefinitely. To recover it, pour the contents of the Erlenmeyer flask, and any washings that contain the black manganese dioxide powder, into an evaporating dish or shallow, wide-mouth jar. Then just set it aside in a window and\/or in front of a fan and let the water evaporate away. The dry manganese dioxide that remains can be reused more-or-less indefinitely. If you're impatient, you can filter the manganese dioxide out of the water using a coffee filter to speed the whole process up.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":437,"image":{"imageid":6764,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/djIhq6Domx4aNOkn"},"introduction":"<p>My <a href=\"\/Project\/Pneumatic+Trough\/431\/1\">previous tutorial<\/a> shows how to construct a simple sheet metal &quot;bridge,&quot; which, in combination with an ice cube bucket and an olive jar, makes an effective pneumatic trough for collecting gas samples over water.
