I'm particularly impressed that someone had the idea to create meringue &quot;mushrooms&quot; to make it even more log-esque. I have found that though the b\u00fbche looks intimidating, it isn't difficult at all. In fact, I have even taught children as young as six to do it. The only downside to the b\u00fbche is that it's not a nondenomination<wbr \/>al cake. Since No\u00ebl refers to the birth of Christ, this cake remains firmly in the Christmas camp.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which led me to the creation of the Thanksgiving B\u00fbche, or B\u00fbche de Gratitude as I like to call it. In my humble opinion, a cake in the shape of a log makes more sense on a holiday that celebrates that first feast between the pilgrims and the Native Americans. One would imagine they ate outdoors in close proximity (or possibly sitting upon) real logs, after all.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this b\u00fbche, a moist pumpkin sponge cake, or genoise, is baked, rolled, filled with cream cheese frosting, frosted with decadent chocolate buttercream, and then studded with - what else - cocoa-dusted meringue mushrooms.
