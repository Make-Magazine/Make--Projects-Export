Mostly because there is nothing special about them (from the electronics point of view) but after seeing QlockTwo made by Biegert&amp;Funk I simply couldn't resist making one that looks that nice. But of course, in my local language. Aside from different language, I wanted it to be able to display full time - every minute of an hour - so I ended up using 248 white LEDs. To keep that stealthy look I used two capacitive touch sensors under the glass (near left and right LED dots) as buttons for the user-input.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/PbtWs3_Ygfk?t=27s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/PbtWs3_Ygfk?t=27s<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Project details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elektronika.ba\/841\/word-clock\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http:\/\/www.elektronika.ba\/841\/word-clock\/\">http:\/\/www.elektronika.ba\/841\/word-clock...<\/a><\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I have been seeing these &quot;Word Clocks&quot; all over the internet for the past few years, but they never really impressed me much.
