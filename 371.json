The English word &quot;bokeh&quot; has to do with the aesthetics of out-of-focus points of light. Different types of lenses may render different qualities of bokeh, so if you own an SLR or DSLR, experiment! With this project, you can create an effect where the out-of-focus point-source lights in your pictures appear any shape you want.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YZjV94FbjRE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>&quot;Bokeh&quot; comes from the Japanese word &quot;boke&quot; (\u6688\u3051 or \u30dc\u30b1) which means blur or haze.
