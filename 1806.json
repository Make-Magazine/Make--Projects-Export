The Nomad's Closet occupies the space above the foot of a bed or couch, and provides enough real estate for a dozen or so hanging shirts and about 6 pairs of pants AND a hanging shelf, WITH room on top for your empty suitcases.<\/p>\n\n<p>The total cost to build (not including the hanging shelf) is right around $40, depending on where you are in the world. The materials can be purchased from any hardware store that sells 1 1\/4&quot; PVC &amp; Elbows\/T's. Shopping at a smaller hardware store may be important to you if you do not travel with tools, or if you will not have access to tools when you arrive. You will likely be able to just hand them the PDF\/JPG that I have included and ask them to make the cuts for you at the store. Granted, that may cost a few extra bucks. If you have the tools or you don't mind picking up a cheap hack saw and screwdriver, you can get the job done yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Watch the video to see me assemble this Nomad's Closet. Then, follow the steps to make your own. Remember to share your builds or mods!<\/p>\n\n<p>Enjoy...<\/p>\n\n<p>PS...
