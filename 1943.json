{"device":"Microcontrolled Bots","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/Tiny+Wanderer+%22Moth%22\/1943\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Doug Paradis","userid":9627},"categories":["Microcontrolled Bots"],"conclusion":"<p>The &quot;tw_moth_anti-moth&quot; program has a routine to allow you to zero your servos. By depressing the bumper switch within the first 2 seconds after robot start-up, the robot sends a continuous zero signal (1.5 ms pulse) to the servos. To leave the mode turn off the robot and restart.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also change the robot behavior from moth to anti-moth by changing a variable in the .c program file.<\/p>\n\n<p>My experience is that the robot works best in lighting conditions that are not extreme. For example a moderately lit room during daytime with a light on. This situation provides for subtle shadows and interesting runs. A room flooded with light (night time with bright overhead lights) can saturate the sensors and cause the robot to just travel straight, since it can not sense enough difference between the directions.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"tw_moth_anti-moth.h.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/LQZUbBLPeuR3E1Kv.pdf","documentid":248},{"text":"tw_moth_anti-moth.c.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/1CMBQCADNA4QkXYa.pdf","documentid":250}],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1943,"image":{"imageid":39081,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/iMZqfkyZgJRV4tfS"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/37227430?portrait=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>Adding CdS photocell sensors to your Tiny Wanderer robot allows it to see a spectrum of light that is similar to what humans perceive.
