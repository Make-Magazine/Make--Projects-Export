The displacer isn\u2019t really doing any work, it\u2019s just taking up space to move the air to one side or the other, so that the heating and cooling can do the work.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Building_and_Operating_Tips\">Building and Operating Tips<\/h3>\n\n<p>Building a Stirling engine can be a real challenge. If you undertake this project, take your time. Be patient. Go over all instructions carefully, watch the video, and read the discussion of the <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/go\/stirling\">Instructables version<\/a> before you start work. Here are some tips to increase your chance of success:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>The piston can be difficult to cast. Don\u2019t try mixing the epoxy in the cylinder. Mix it outside, then pour it in. It may take several attempts.<\/li><li>Grease the cylinder before casting.<\/li><li>The piston should fit snugly in the cylinder but not too tightly, and should not slide loosely. Remember, the copper pipe has casting grooves in it that the cast piston must travel in.<\/li><li>Leaks are your enemy. Make sure everything \u2014 the displacer chamber, the piston cylinder \u2014 is as airtight as possible.<\/li><li>Friction is your other enemy. Make sure the crankshaft and lever rods travel as smoothly and frictionlessly as possible.<\/li><li>You want the 2 displacer plates to have the greatest possible temperature differential (around 200\u00b0F). Try putting ice on the cold plate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/17\">MAKE Volume 17<\/a>, page 68.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Difficult","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1154,"image":{"imageid":22650,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/44GdZW5CEuIEQIUy"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kfEsMYtOHcE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>There\u2019s energy all around us, just waiting to be tapped.
