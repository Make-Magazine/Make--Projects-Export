Everyone can use his or her own bicycle and make it amphibious. The conversion time from land to water is not more than 7 minutes; the same for the opposite direction. The design is usable for any bicycle and the construction is simple, safe and cheap; about 100 dollars.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project sounds easy; it's not. If it were that simple, we could buy an amphibious bike in the local cycleshop. However, this video shows enough information to make one of your own.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the water Berto's Amphi-Cycle is propelled by a new version of the simple outboard motor, using a cordless drill powered by a large 12V battery.
