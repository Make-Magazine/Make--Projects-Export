These are pricey--you're doing well if you can pay less than $1 apiece--but look absolutely great. They can be sealed with acrylic cement or, as I prefer, with a loop of scotch tape around the edge. If you want to go this route, I recommend making the 3\/4&quot; deep cabinet instead of the 1.1&quot; deep cabinet shown here. The bug boxes are only about 7\/8&quot; deep and they can be difficult to remove from the deeper cabinet.<\/p>\n\n<p>This cabinet only includes s, p, and d-blocks. Eventually I'm going to design a separate f-block cabinet for the lanthanides and actinides, which I will post on Thingiverse.
