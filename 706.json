It\u2019s inspiring, fun to watch, and good for heating up your garage or workshop on a cold day.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1860, Dutch physics professor Pieter Rijke was investigating the relationship between sounds, gases, and fire. He stuffed a piece of iron mesh inside a large glass tube, then held it over a gas flame until the mesh was red-hot. Suddenly, the contraption emitted a sustained musical tone so loud that workers several rooms away complained.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intrigued, Rijke\u2019s colleagues set out to discover the reason for \u201cthe singing flames.\u201d Some thought it was the periodic evaporation and condensation of water, but later scientists showed that the sound was caused by waves of air, set in recurring motion by the fire\u2019s heat. Hot air, being less dense, moved upward while cool air sank. This vibrating air resonated at the natural frequency of the tube.<\/p>\n\n<p>Years after Rijke\u2019s work, German scientist Heinrich Rubens turned the idea on its head. He knew fire could produce resonating sound waves. Was it was possible to use fire to make sound waves visible for the first time? In his laboratory at the University of Berlin he developed the standing wave flame tube, also called the Rubens tube in his honor.<\/p>\n\n<p>The flame tube (aka Rubens tube) is a waveform visualizer. It works because sound is a pressure wave. As sound moves through a gas like propane, the wave alternately compresses and expands the gas in different regions. When you use a frequency generator to produce a constant tone of, say, 440Hz (the musical note A), the speaker pushes this sound through the gas, and a stationary wave is set up.<\/p>\n\n<p>The stationary wave causes areas of high pressure to appear at fixed points along the pipe, spaced half-wavelengths apart. Where the pressure is high, the propane is driven more strongly out of the pipe, resulting in a tall flame. Between these high-pressure points will be low pressure points that create lower flames.<\/p>\n\n<p>When music is played instead of the frequency generator output, the clean curves of the sine wave are replaced by much more chaotic and perhaps even more intriguing patterns. Strong vibration from drums and low-frequency sounds from bass guitars, tubas, and string basses cause the flame tube to send fire pulses out of the holes nearest the loudspeaker. Overlaying that are sine waves that are visible whenever the musical pitches being played coincide with the tube\u2019s resonant frequencies. This layering of resonant frequencies and bass beats produces a dazzling display of musical pyrotechnics.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c2PmkXkBQ-4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WRWdpam_2to?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Fiery devices have always fascinated me.
