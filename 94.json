I stick the whole brewed pot in the fridge and mix in sugar and milk on a cup-by-cup basis. But why doesn't granulated sugar dissolve well in my iced coffee? Just remember back to chemistry and physics: slower-moving molecules in the cold liquid don't bounce around and react with the sugar as quickly or as energetically as in a hot cup o' joe. I'm going to show you how to exploit this principle in the opposite direction. By combining heated water with an equal quantity of sugar, a concentrated solution is formed that holds true upon cooling. This new liquid substance has all the same sweetness of granulated sugar, but will mix easily into ice coffees and teas.
