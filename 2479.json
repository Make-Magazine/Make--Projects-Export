Of the mods and improvements Tom suggests in his original article, the only one we haven't achieved in this build is the addition of an ultrasonic rangefinder, which Tom describes as &quot;way advanced.&quot; But note that Parallax now makes a handy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radioshack.com\/product\/index.jsp?productId=12326359\" rel=\"nofollow\">all-in-one ultrasonic range sensor<\/a> that would fit nicely on the front of the Mini Rover's camera box, with plenty of room inside that box for whatever electronics it needs.  As for operator feedback, Tom suggests an audible &quot;ping&quot; sound that gets higher as you get closer to an object, and reports back through the camera's on-board microphone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Demounted from the ROV, these wireless video cameras are pretty fun toys in and of themselves, and would be an easy way to experiment with XKCD-style &quot;giant head&quot; <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/2011\/10\/06\/the-xkcd-giant-head-enhanced-depth-perception-project\/\">depth perception enhancement<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>What would *you* do with it?

Tom, who was honored in 2009 as California's Volunteer of the Year for his unpaid teaching campaign in public schools, developed the idea as a hands-on activity to accompany his talks about the Mars rover program. Basically, he mounted an X10 wireless surveillance camera on a small R\/C car frame, fixed some magnets to the front bumper, and challenged students to drive the vehicle  around remotely and pick up scattered tin cans with the magnets.<\/p>\n\n<p>That project was published as &quot;Mini Mars Rover&quot; in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/06\">MAKE Volume 06<\/a>, back in 2006. The X10 XCAM2 wireless video camera specified in Tom's original build was one of the first small, inexpensive CMO-based 2.4 GHz wireless surveillance cameras marketed for home use. It has a maximum resolution of 510\u00d7492, and no onboard battery. Students who play with the project, Tom says, &quot;soon find out that driving is a lot harder when their field of vision is as narrow as a video camera's.&quot; At the end of his article, Tom suggests several improvements for the ROV, including making your own battery pack (to save on the expense of buying a commercial one), adding a second camera (for back-up or front-bumper views), and adding onboard lights (for nighttime or low-light conditions).<\/p>\n\n<p>Wireless video technology has come a long way since 2006, and we felt like it was time for a reboot.
