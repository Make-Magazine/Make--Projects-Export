The more water you\u2019re able to flow through the gun, the more snow you\u2019ll have piling up. Expect 2&quot;\u20135&quot; per hour, at 2gpm flow. Some advice to keep in mind:<\/p>\n\n<ol><li>Don\u2019t shoot snow against the wind. You\u2019ll get freeze-ups. Go with the wind to make life easier.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Install a check valve between your compressor and the snow gun; this will prevent flooding of your compressor. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Air compressors are loud, so if you plan to make snow overnight or in the early morning, be considerate of neighbors. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Your snow gun will hiss like a gas leak, so inform your neighbors that it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Wear plenty of warm clothing when you\u2019re making snow, because it will be cold outside, and when you\u2019re working with water and metal pipe it will seem a lot colder. Wear good waterproof gloves.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Don\u2019t leave your hose outside with water in it, or it will freeze and possibly split. Bring it inside. If it does freeze, throw it in a bathtub of warm water. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n<ol><li>Last but not least, have fun! <\/li><\/ol>\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to the contributors to <a href=\"http:\/\/snowguns.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">snowguns.com<\/a>, where much of this information came from.
