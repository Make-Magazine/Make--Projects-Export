If you change something, something bad (or good) might happen. Working with op-amp band-pass filters, a slight change in the values given will throw off the results. HOWEVER: You may not end up using all the parts (e.g., screw terminals) because you may not solder your LM386 set on a board. I only included them because I did solder them. And they are used for power and signal out. But other than that, nothing should be unused or traded out. You might also not use the second audio jack. It is not mandatory, but it would be silly if you can't hear the music\/sound with your new spectrum analyzer. The second jack allows you to plug in your speakers while they are disconnected by the first jack.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1105,"image":{"imageid":21724,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/LYBh2IQtayrISdIM"},"introduction":"<p>As complicated as I thought this would be, this circuit is using the basic fundamentals of electronics and algebra.
