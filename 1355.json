If it wasn\u2019t, this would suggest that the Betsy Ross flag story is a fabrication. (I coudn\u2019t resist that one.) But yes, 8\u00bd&quot;\u00d711&quot; paper was available then. That size goes back to Europe in 1600, the result of a 17&quot;\u00d722&quot; sheet cut into four pieces. Not until the time of the first World War did 8\u00bd&quot;\u00d711&quot; paper become standard for business in the United States. I\u2019ve tried similar constructions starting with sheets of other sizes, but these usually result in awkward unanticipated difficulties.<\/p>\n\n<p>The story of the invention of this star construction method remains to be told. Who was the clever person who discovered it? I shall resist idle speculation about how the size of paper necessary for this construction might mystically relate to the Golden Mean or to the Fibonacci sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Congress did not specify how the stars were to be arranged. Many flags of that time and earlier had \u201cstars and stripes,\u201d with the stars arranged in various ways. Flags with stars in a circle were rare. A painting by Charles H. Weisgerber, made in 1870, shows Betsy Ross stitching a flag with stars in a circle while Washington, Morris, and George Ross look on.<\/p>\n\n<p>That suggests another mystery. What trick of geometry, or origami, would you need in order to arrange 13 stars perfectly spaced around a circle?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project frist appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/19\">MAKE Volume 19<\/a>, page164.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1355,"image":{"imageid":27289,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/bKfQEVBsYxJIxCj3"},"introduction":"<p>Historical legend tells us that seamstress Betsy Ross was visited in 1776 by George Washington, Robert Morris, and George Ross, who asked her to make an American flag conforming to a resolution of the Continental Congress.<\/p>\n\n<p>Washington\u2019s design had 13 alternating stripes of white and red, and 13 six-pointed stars on a field of blue.
