I find that each coil has a resistance of between 8\u03a9 and 9\u03a9, and works well between 6V and 12V. Increasing the voltage will up the power, but will also increase the heat generated by the coil. Experiment to find the maximum voltage for a particular application, and with long duty cycles, stick a thermal fuse next to the coil for safety\u2019s sake.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1976,"image":{"imageid":39418,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/K325lKoCAblmIV5n"},"introduction":"<p>Linear actuators are motors that work in a straight line.
