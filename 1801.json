Sound-reactive inverters are available, but most of these are only &quot;single channel&quot;, so the wires are either all on or all off. To really make your display dynamic you need an inverter with multiple output channels, but these are quite expensive. Fortunately, you can make your EL wire decoration more animated inexpensively by reusing the inverter from a &quot;graphic equalizer&quot; T-shirt (a.k.a. T-qualizer) to drive five separate EL wires at five different volume thresholds.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Most EL wire displays are static, because they use an inverter that simply turns the EL wire on (i.e. constant-on).
