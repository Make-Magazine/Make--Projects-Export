However, because of the addition of breakout headers, an ICSP connector and on-board step-down voltage regulator, it can also be used as a flexible development platform that can accommodate any compatible Microchip 8-pin PIC microcontroller<wbr \/>s. This makes this board an excellent launching point for many other projects as well.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"Grade-Crossing-Signal-Controll.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/ei1QjlNhTZgMgEHh.pdf","documentid":308},{"text":"gcsc_ii.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/lXKr6QTophJi4VMl.pdf","documentid":309},{"text":"GCSC-II-Wiring-Diagram-Rev-B.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/kEZWdxjjWFr5lgIS.pdf","documentid":310},{"text":"gcsc_ii_assembly.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/jblnYxAZbtZpHCDO.pdf","documentid":311},{"text":"Print---gcsc_ii_ListByValues.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/lA2cKhERuggiPT32.pdf","documentid":312}],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2403,"image":{"imageid":47770,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/PWukN3WCL2VdfKbb"},"introduction":"<p>This project guide explains how to build an operating railroad grade crossing signal controller (GCSC) for controlling a simulated railroad crossing signal that has working flashing lamps and striking bell.
