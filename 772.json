I began by making a crude study model, with all body-supporting surfaces adjustable: the seat, the back, armrests, headrest, footstool, the angle between the seat and back, even the overall size. The model\u2019s only given: it would use a set of standard patio chair cushions and one sheet of plywood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Somewhere in the middle of seemingly infinite adjustments, I discovered that recliners really are much more comfortable than upright chairs, so I threw reclinability into the mix as well.

I call it the Rok-Bak chair.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Rok-Bak is very comfortable, easy and inexpensive to build, can be assembled or disassembled in a few minutes, and can be stored and moved about easily, taking up very little space.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re really ambitious, you can upholster your own cushions (as I did with expert help from my brother Phil), as well as the headrest and footstool, for a perfectly matched set. The upholstery techniques are similar for most any fabric. You can cut the chair parts with a jigsaw and a circular saw.
