Actually I don't think he remembers his uncle at all. This is a solution for Bosung. I made a hand puppet that can call my nephew's name (&quot;Bosung!&quot;) when the puppet's right arm is up.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/15552207?portrait=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>This is a project from my collaboration class at school, made to solve a problem that I have.
