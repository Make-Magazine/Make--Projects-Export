As a kid, I thought shelled walnuts looked like tiny little brains. This gave me an idea: What if I coated them with candy for Halloween? I envisioned eating handfuls of tiny candy brains\u2026laughing maniacally. That could be fun, but if they were placed in miniature edible skulls, it would really put them over the top. If those skulls were white chocolate\u2026 Well, now we\u2019re talking!<\/p>\n\n<p>I just needed a way to make the skulls. Sculpting each one with modeling chocolate would quickly become tedious, so making some sort of mold seemed like the obvious solution.

A white chocolate shell with a surprise bittersweet center sounded tasty.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trouble with skulls is they\u2019re quite complex with lots of nooks and crannies and undercuts. To do a somewhat realistic version would normally require sophisticated (i.e. expensive) multi-part molds.

I plan to try the silicone Plastique in the future, an easy to use 2-part putty, when I have a less ambitious shape to mold. This time, I got the CopyFlex 2-part liquid silicone set with platinum. It\u2019s a bit expensive, costing me around $30 for enough material to cast a 4-skull mold.
