Imagine for a moment you're a member of the \u201cWide Awakes,\u201d one of many political marching clubs organized to drum up support for political candidates. Since marching is what you do, you and your fellow Wide Awakes do it often and are very good at it. Everyone in the group (and there are thousands) owns a torch.

To satisfy the need for parade torches, scores of small manufacturing companies sprang up across the United States to fabricate them.
