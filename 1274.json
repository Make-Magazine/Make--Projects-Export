You actually shift the warp bar, and therefore the warp, around the whole frame. So even though the loom is only 22&quot; tall, you have 40&quot; of workable warp! With the use of 2 heddle bars, it\u2019s easy to open up 2 sheds for all sorts of tapestry weaving adventures. The materials cost less than $20, and it takes about 20 minutes to make the loom\u2019s frame and then 2 to 3 hours to warp it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can make your loom any size. I have looms ranging from 8&quot;\u00d710&quot; to 18&quot;\u00d722&quot;; just remember that if you go larger than that, you need to build your frame from wood that is at least 1&quot;\u00d72\u00bd&quot; or the tension of the warps will, well, warp your frame.
