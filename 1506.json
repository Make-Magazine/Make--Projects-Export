You will want to keep rain and dust out of it as much as possible, as it would be quite a chore to clean THOUSANDS of balls every time there was a rainstorm.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it does come time to clean your ball pit, remove them all the balls and store them in garbare bags. Clean the interior of your ball pit with any GENTLE cleaner that is safe to use on foam or rubber and be sure to give it ample time to dry before re-adding any balls.  Take a few hundred balls at a time and wash them in your bathtub and\/or spray them down with a one part bleach, nine-part water solution before put them somewhere to dry.  DO NOT PUT DAMP BALLS INTO YOUR BALL PIT. Repeat washing, drying, and then re-adding your balls to your ball pit until all are clean.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":1506,"image":{"imageid":0,"text":"http:\/\/cacher.dozuki.net\/static\/images\/make\/guide\/NoImageMP_96x72.gif"},"introduction":"<p>A lot of people have asked \u201cWhy would you, as an adult, want to own a ball pit?\u201d And the answer every time is \u201cbecause of <a href=\"http:\/\/xkcd.com\/150\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this xkcd comic<\/a>.\u201d There\u2019s something about a ball pit that just screams PURE FUN.
