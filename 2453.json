A sunbeam on a kitchen floor is a great spot; MSE-5 will happily wander around inside it as long as the batteries hold out.  You can also lead it around with a bright flashlight beam, so long as there are not too many competing IR sources around.  The sun is hard to beat, as IR sources go, and you'll find that, like a cat, MSE-5 is easily distracted by windows.<\/p>\n\n<p>To observe the sound-reactive behavior, &quot;startle&quot; the 'bot with any loud sound like a clap or a shout.  The condenser mic element has some directionality, so sounds in front of the robot are more likely to trigger the &quot;flight&quot; reflex than sounds from the rear.  Hard impacts will often trigger the reflex as well, though not as reliably as the original Mousey's mechanical bump switch.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speaking of, it would not be difficult to add a Mousey-style contact switch to the MSE-5 platform and turn it into a light-, sound-, and contact-responding  design. The timing circuit that mediates the sound-activated &quot;startle&quot; response could easily be tripped by a mechanical switch, as well, and there's plenty of room right below MSE-5's &quot;head,&quot; between the motors, to mount an additional small accessory with Superlock tape, and electrical access to the startle reflex through the microphone port immediately above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hmmmm...I wonder what else we could put there...<\/p>","difficulty":"Difficult","documents":[{"text":"MSE5-circuit-diagram-1-0.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/fvJiQAg5Bw24EhVC.pdf","documentid":322},{"text":"MSE-5-Breadboard-Solder-Traces.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/GVfKUh5IcCSZyS3T.pdf","documentid":323}],"flags":[{"title":"Weekend Project","flagid":"GUIDE_SPONSOR_RADIO_SHACK","text":"This project is part of RadioShack's The Great Create."},{"title":"Featured Guide","flagid":"GUIDE_STARRED","text":"This project has been found to be exceptionally cool by the MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2453,"image":{"imageid":49042,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/uXchKFYr4k2D6SNu"},"introduction":"<p>MSE-5 is a direct descendant of Gareth Branwyn's <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.streettech.com\/robotbook\/mousey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mousey the Junkbot<\/a><\/em>, as published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.make-digital.com\/make\/vol02\/?pg=98&amp;pm=2&amp;u1=friend\" rel=\"nofollow\">in MAKE Volume 02<\/a>.  Like Mousey, MSE-5 uses a simple circuit to drive two small electric motors, varying the voltage between them depending on the amount of light shining on its two &quot;eyes&quot; (which are really just small IR phototransistor<wbr \/>s). The robot always tries to turn toward whichever side of its body is exposed to more light, and thus &quot;seeks out&quot; the brightest IR source in its environment, which is often the light source, whether it's a light bulb or sunlight through a window.  Mousey and MSE-5 belong to a class of light-sensitve robots called &quot;phototropes.&quot;  They'll happily wander around in a sunbeam, or chase a flashlight across a darkened floor, as long as the batteries hold out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Like Mousey, MSE-5 also has a &quot;backpedal&quot; reflex that temporarily reverses its motors in response to certain environmental stimuli.  In Mousey, the reflex is tripped by a simple mechanical &quot;bump switch&quot; positioned at the front of the body: if Mousey runs into something, the switch is depressed, a relay is triggered, and the motors run in reverse for a few seconds, causing Mousey to back away from the obstacle.<\/p>\n\n<p>MSE-5 replaces Mousey's bump switch with a microphone and a simple circuit that amplifies sound, filters it, and activates a relay in response to any sharp, loud noise like a clap or a shout.
