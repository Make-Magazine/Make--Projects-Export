Luckily a friend of mine who is a developer clued me into microcontroller<wbr \/>s, and then I did some research and learned about the Arduino, its many shields, and the Wave Shield kit from the fabulous Adafruit Industries (<a href=\"http:\/\/adafruit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/adafruit.com<\/a>), which stores WAV audio files that your Arduino can play.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to nagging, timing is everything, so this project uses a real-time clock (RTC) chip, which also contains a calendar.
