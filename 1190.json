The coolness factor is priceless!<\/p>\n\n<p>A well-made pair of custom roller skates can last you years, with countless hours of fun to be had. Studies have shown that 1 hour of moderate roller-skating by a 140-pound person burns 330 calories, and vigorous skating up to 590 calories. Apart from the health benefits, skating is also a great way to socialize with other skaters at the rink or park.<\/p>\n\n<p>This step-by-step instruction guide should be followed carefully to ensure the safety of your skates.
