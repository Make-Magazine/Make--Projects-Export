I was able to pick up a USB web cam for $10 at a local bigbox store. The antique cameras I picked up on ebay for $1. Actually, I picked up (2) cameras for $1 each and the shipping was only $5. That was a great deal. You can easily pick one up for less than $10 online or a local antiques shop.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":131,"image":{"imageid":8207,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/LslDDTCKimUKXBlu"},"introduction":"<p>A while ago I converted a 1934 folding camera into a USB web cam.
