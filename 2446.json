Cooking stove-top always ends up covering my stove in grease spatters (and sometimes the spatters hit my hands \u2014 that doesn't exactly feel good!). I also think it's tedious and slow. It makes so much less mess to cook bacon in the oven than on the stove top. Depending on the size of baking pan you use you can usually cook the whole package at once instead of just a few pieces at a time.
