It requires long, thin strips of stretchy rubber \u2014 a material produced first in the late 1800s and not widely available until the early 1900s. The idea is really an update of the ancient sling (a leather pocket tied to 2 leather strips), the weapon purportedly used by David to bring down Goliath.<\/li><li>Rubber got its name from Joseph Priestley (inventor of soda water), who noticed that blobs of it were good for rubbing pencil marks off paper.<\/li><li>If there was no air resistance to contend with, a pebble fired from a slingshot would travel in what is referred to as a ballistic trajectory. From the moment the pebble leaves the pocket of the slingshot, gravity bends its path down towards Earth. Put the air back into the equation and the path gets even shorter. Without air resistance, your pebble would travel almost twice as far.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>Excerpted from <em>Fifty Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do)<\/em> by Gever Tulley with Julie Spiegler (<a href=\"http:\/\/fiftydangerousthings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/fiftydangerousthings.com<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/28\">MAKE: Volume 28<\/a>, page 156.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1878,"image":{"imageid":38247,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/RMJidkYckb3EWGaT"},"introduction":"<p>A slingshot master can hit a soda can from 20 paces.
