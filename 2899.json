In other words, ideally this greenhouse could be left for a year in any (reasonable) climate and the seeds that were meant to grow would flourish totally unattended.  It would be perfectly tailored to the vegetation inside to maximize its efficiency.  Such a greenhouse would require cognitive abilities to sense its surrounding environment and either use or block certain conditions while it preserves a micro-climate within the walls of the house.<\/p>\n\n<p>Variables that are most important for crop success are those such as air temperature, soil moisture and humidity level.  This particular model greenhouse addresses two of these factors: air temperature and soil moisture.  The greenhouse utilizes an Arduino UNO microprocessor and various sensors to regulate these two variables within a desired set of thresholds.  These thresholds will, of course, vary with the type of crops that one would want to grow in the greenhouse.  Inside the structure is a Texas Instruments LM 34 sensor which measures air temperature.  This sensor informs the Arduino which then controls opening and closing of roof servos to let hot air out and cool air in if the greenhouse is overheating. By use of the mechanical roof the greenhouse can autonomously keep the inside temperature to a desired level, assuming that this level is somewhat within the natural range of the surrounding environment.  Additionally, the Smart Greenhouse has an irrigation system triggered by a timer function in the code that can be varied in frequency depending on a plant's optimal watering cycle.  The timer activates the internal drip irrigation via a servo-controlled valve.<\/p>\n\n<p>A possible addition to the Smart Greenhouse would be a soil-moisture sensor. This sensor could inform the drip irrigation system when the soil is too dry, creating a need-based watering pattern and potentially conserving water.<\/p>\n\n<p>All these features make the Smart Greenhouse one of the most intelligent and cost-effective of its kind.
