First ,remove the hardware and boots. Pick the ski in best shape to be the front of your piece with the coat hooks affixed to it. The hooks will be on the topside of the ski, the surface where your foot would go. The poorer condition ski will form the shelf across the top so it's surface won't be visible. Use a 2'(or less) piece of 1x2 to hold the two skis together. Fasten the 1x2 to the back side edge of the &quot;good&quot; ski with 2 1.5&quot; screws. The &quot;poorer&quot; ski is then screwed into the 1x2 so it rests on this and the upper edge of the first ski, forming a 45 degree angle. Attach 6 hooks to the front surface of the 'good&quot; ski and hang the whole unit on the wall.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I turned two vintage wooden water skis into a coat rack for my front hall.
