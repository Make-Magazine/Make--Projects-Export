The trick for using oil to make the support invisible worked great.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next time, I would like to find an oil or other medium that is even closer to the refractive index of Pyrex.  With Wesson oil, there's still a very faint blue &quot;ghost&quot; of the glass shape visible in the raw photographs, though this is not difficult to remove digitally.  Also, I'd like to find a medium that is truly &quot;water white&quot; and does not require color correction from yellow.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/janed\/3319074600\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reportedly<\/a>, baby oil is an improvement on both counts.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":1929,"image":{"imageid":39351,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/urcRWWbpZwagwxCP"},"introduction":"<p>Recently, I needed a special photograph for my <a href=\"\/Project\/Soda+Can+Label+Embossing\/1921\/1\">Soda Can Label Embossing<\/a> project.
