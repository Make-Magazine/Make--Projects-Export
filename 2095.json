It\u2019s really convenient to pull it up on my phone and check the cars in the driveway to see who\u2019s home, or to make sure all is well around the house when we\u2019re on vacation. Others use it, too; friends of mine who travel south for the winter check it to see how much snow is piling up back in Pittsburgh!<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, I have experimented with X10 controllable pan-and-tilt mechanisms for the cameras, which may become permanent additions to the system. I also used EzCom2Web (easyvitools.co<wbr \/>m\/ezcom2web) to add a web-based control page that lets you pan, tilt, and switch the cameras.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope you find this system just as useful as I have. Give it a try and let me know if I can help (dave@davebodna<wbr \/>r.com).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/30\">MAKE Volume 30<\/a>, page 44.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2095,"image":{"imageid":41894,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/GvQimuFSdXH5eDAO"},"introduction":"<p>My basement office\/workshop is a fair distance from the front of the house, and I frequently want to check the front porch for mail, UPS deliveries, and the arrival of friends.
