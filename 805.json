There is much room for improvement here. For instance, if this were a long-term project, much code optimization would need to be done to have the processor &quot;sleep.&quot; Also, for alerting purposes, perhaps an LED or some audible alert could be added.<\/p>\n\n<p>In O'Reilly's &quot;Arduino Cookbook,&quot; in recipe 14.1 <em>Sending Messages Using Low-Cost Wireless Modules<\/em>, there is much more information about using these RF modules.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can get the book here at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=EARDCOOK\">Maker Shed<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For another mailbox alert system, check out Matt Richardson's <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/archive\/2010\/12\/snail-mail-push-alerts.html\">Snail Mail Push Alerts<\/a> project.<\/p>\n\n<p>And for lots more Arduino, take a gander at the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/arduino\">Make: Arduino<\/a> page.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":805,"image":{"imageid":13517,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/YUUuHljDINHRIxe6"},"introduction":"<p>Many inventions\/hack<wbr \/>s often arise out of the need to solve a problem.
