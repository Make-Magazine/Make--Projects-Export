Two reasons: Ideal water temperature and optimal contact between the grounds and the water. Water turns to vapor prior to boiling, and then heads out of the boiling flask and into the ground coffee. This means your water is right around 200\u00b0F when the brewing begins. Electric drip brewers are notorious for their wildly inaccurate brew temperatures (and the sour brews they can produce as a result).<\/p>\n\n<p>All of the water in a siphon brewer is in contact with all of the grounds during the entire brewing process. This gives the water the greatest chance to extract the things we want out of the coffee grounds. In all but the best drip brewers, a tiny stream of water flows quickly through the center of the grounds, leaving behind much of the flavor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you get the hang of your siphon brewer, you can brew for a very precise amount of time. When the vacuum pressure is great enough, it will pull the coffee back into the flask rapidly. You can instigate this by cooling the flask with cold water, or even a wet cloth, although I\u2019d be careful not to shock the glass too much with an ice bath.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/17\">MAKE Volume 17<\/a>, page 63.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1151,"image":{"imageid":22523,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/dSqUgQOT2Qayw1gL"},"introduction":"<p>The vacuum siphon coffee brewing method dates back to the 1840s. It produces some of the cleanest, smoothest-tasting coffee of any method.

Thus the Florence Siphon was born!<\/p>\n\n<p>After studying original patent drawings and existing devices, I identified these key features:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Water is heated in a boiling flask that has a tube leading to a second vessel containing ground coffee.<\/li><li>The tube must have a filter, to allow the water to flow through but not the grounds. <\/li><li>The filter must be submerged during brewing, so as to maintain a seal with the boiling flask.<\/li><li>The second vessel must be accessible for stirring the slurry. <\/li><li>The boiling flask must be large enough to create a sufficient vacuum as it cools to \u201cpull\u201d the coffee back through.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>One drawback to early vacuum brewers was the constant danger of exploding glass. Today, we have plenty of high-quality borosilicate glassware that\u2019s up to the task \u2014 it just happens to be found in the lab, not the kitchen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Filtration was another challenge. I tinkered with a few options (including an unfortunate foray into shower heads) before arriving at an inverted thistle tube.

I filled my flask with preheated water (small burners can take a while to boil 500ml), poured 38g of medium-ground coffee into the beaker, donned my goggles, and lit the burner.<\/p>\n\n<p>The water began to bubble quickly, and soon went straight up the glass tube and over to the grounds. After about a minute, the flask was nearly empty and I extinguished the flame. At this point, there was an abundance of expanded water vapor (steam) inside the flask, which prevented the water from returning.<\/p>\n\n<p>I stirred up the slurry with a stick and then waited with great excitement. Would the siphon be able to draw the coffee back up? At just about the 2-minute mark, I saw the gorgeous brown liquid begin its ascent. This is due to the vacuum created by the cooling and contraction of water vapor in the boiling flask. It was tentative at first, but as the boiling flask continued to cool, the coffee started to move quickly up the tube, over and then back down to the flask below. Within another 20 seconds, the journey was complete: 420ml of coffee made it back, leaving 80ml of water behind with the grounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>I removed the stopper and poured myself a cup. It was perfect! Smooth, bright, clear, and clean. Vacuum coffee is a step above a French press, and leagues above drip. Plus, when you brew with the Florence Siphon you get to don your lab coat and cackle maniacally. What more could you want from a cup of coffee?<\/p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how to build your own Florence Siphon.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>The vacuum siphon coffee brewing method dates back to the 1840s.
