To avoid this, use a spirit lamp. You can make a simple one by drilling a hole in the metal lid of a very small glass or metal container, threading through a lantern wick, then filling the container with denatured alcohol.<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve also made spirit lamps out of copper pipe caps and copper tubing. Cut a 1\u00bc&quot; pipe cap short enough to fit under the boiler with room for the flame, then sweat-solder it onto a sheet metal bottom. Drill holes in the cap and solder in 2 lengths of \u00bc&quot; tubing: a very short one on top (the wick holder) and a longer one in the side (the filling tube and handle), bent upwards.<\/p>\n\n<p>With candles, this engine needs more than a single small flame to get moving. Use 2 or 3 birthday candles or a tea light with more than one wick.<\/p>\n\n<p>See how MAKE Labs engineering intern Daniel Spangler made a <a href=\"\/Project\/Copper+Pipe+Alcohol+Lamp\/1396\/1\">Copper Pipe Alcohol Lamp<\/a> for the Pop-Pop Steamboat.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/28\">MAKE Volume 28<\/a>, page 70.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2415,"image":{"imageid":47198,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/SRMJOasnmDICQK5I"},"introduction":"<p>When you picture a steam engine, you likely imagine a giant cast-iron contraption festooned with knobs, valves, gauges, linkages, and wheels.

This draws cool water back up through the pipes and into the boiler, where the cycle starts again. Because the water sucking back into the tube is incoherent, coming in from all directions, rather than in a directed jet, this intake cycle doesn\u2019t pull the boat backward.

Since aluminum can\u2019t easily be soldered, I\u2019ve substituted J-B Weld epoxy, which is up to the task: its maximum operating temperature of 500\u00b0F exceeds the melting point of most soft solders, and its tensile strength is comparable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ponyo notwithstanding<wbr \/>, this type of engine does not scale up to life-sized boats (nor, for that matter, are there sea wizards or magic talking fish).
