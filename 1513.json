You can hang up the flags at your Halloween party or hang them outside to help greet trick-or-treaters. The great thing about these flags is that they are reversible, so you can decorate the opposite side for Thanksgiving or Christmas (don't worry, I haven't started decorating for Christmas ... yet).
