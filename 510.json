Each stage can be built separately but they are more effective as a &quot;combo.&quot; In the first stage, we will build an air bender from a PVC pipe which directs the heated and rising air towards the middle of your room. In the second stage we will add forced ventilation with old PC fans to enhance the heat transfer through ventilation.<\/p>\n\n<p>As winter comes everybody wants to find a way to heat more efficiently.
