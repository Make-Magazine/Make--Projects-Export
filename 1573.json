Similarly, if you want to saw a piece of wood (or plastic, or PVC pipe) so that the cut is as straight as possible, you need a tool to help you guide the saw. A ruler won't help (don't try, you'll just ruin the ruler). Instead, an inexpensive tool called a miter box (sometimes spelled mitre) will do the trick. In this article, I'll explain what a miter box is, and how to use it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Technique originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.craftzine.com\/archive\/2011\/11\/how-to_use_a_miter_box_to_make.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRAFT<\/a>.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>It's possible to draw a fairly straight line with a pencil, but if you want to be accurate, you must use a ruler or straightedge to guide the pencil as you draw.
