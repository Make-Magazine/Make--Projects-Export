Make sure that the wires are clear of the moving parts of the robot, but resist the temptation to start tidying up with zip ties and cable clips until you've got the printer calibrated and running more-or-less as you like it.  Adjustments during setup may require partial dismantling of the printer, including removing the PCB and side panel, and you'll want to save any straightening up until you're fairly confident you won't have to undo it for awhile.<\/p>\n\n<p>This concludes formal assembly of the Mosaic.  There's still a lot to do to get it up and running, and the details of how to do that will vary with the details of the computer and software you use.  When I get mine printing, I will post a description of the process and link it from this guide.  In the meantime, Marcus Dobeck and Rick Pollack have prepared a <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0030\/7372\/files\/Makergear_Getting_Started_Guide.pdf?100098\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getting Started PDF<\/a> that should get you well on your way.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[{"text":"MosaicElectronicsDiagrams.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/htfwrEfaLOEQAhaP.pdf","documentid":234}],"flags":[],"guideid":1764,"image":{"imageid":37124,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/2gTWtMVncSAJ5DaF"},"introduction":"<p>This is the seventh of eight guides in a series documenting my build of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makergear.com\/products\/mosaic-3d-printers\" rel=\"nofollow\">MakerGear's Mosaic<\/a> desktop FDM\/FFF 3D printer kit.<\/p>\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer++-+Part+I%3A+The+Frame\/1616\/1\">the frame<\/a>,<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer+-+Part+II%3A+The+Y-Axis\/1625\/1\">the Y-axis<\/a>,<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer+-+Part+III%3A+The+X-Axis\/1651\/1\">the X-axis<\/a>,<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer+-+Part+IV%3A+The+Z-Axis\/1693\/1\">the Z-axis<\/a>,<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer+-+Part+V%3A+The+Extruder\/1747\/1\">the extruder<\/a>,<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer++-+Part+VI%3A+The+Build+Platform\/1763\/1\">the build platform<\/a>,<\/li><li><strong>the electronics,<\/strong> and<\/li><li><a href=\"\/Project\/The+MakerGear+Mosaic+3D+Printer+-+Part+VIII%3A+The+First+Print\/1843\/1\">the first print<\/a>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<p>This part covers installation and wiring of the electronics that control the printer.
