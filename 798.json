It\u2019s a very basic process that has unlimited outcomes. One of the easiest ways to get a design on almost any surface is to use the photo emulsion process. Once you\u2019ve made the screen, it\u2019s ready to print time and time again. Follow along as I walk through the process of transferring my design to a screen, and printing it on a laptop bag.<\/p>\n\n<p>Work up an idea for your design. On your first attempt, try a one-color design, keep it simple, and have some fun with it. Once you get it figured out, make your design digital. Sara and I created ours in Illustrator, but you can also scan a drawing. If you are really hands-on, you can draw straight onto transparency paper using India ink. You need a solid black positive to burn into the screen. I print on transparencies, using a black and white laser printer. This gives me an easy way to accurately, cheaply, and quickly create a positive.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Silk-screening is a great way to personalize your gear.
