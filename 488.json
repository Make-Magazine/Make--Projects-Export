A weight is fixed at the end of the lever by an M8 screw. The lever should resonate with a frequency of about 2 HZ. When the sensor shakes, an M3 screw fixed on the lever will touch the horizontal spring, and it will close a delay-off circuit which drives a piezoelectric buzzer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/docs.google.com\/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwbGNhbmRjaXJjdWl0ZGlhZ3JhbXxneDoxZjRkMDMyMmM0MTdhMzg0&amp;pli=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Construction drawing (pdf)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F4Lv14WOTdY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/plcandcircuitdiagram\/earthquake-waves-sensor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electric circuit<\/a><\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>An earthquake detector can be a useful home safety device because it alerts you to a quake some seconds before it happens.
