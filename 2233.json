Nearly all sensing of this kind depends upon how long it takes a capacitor to charge (known as the time constant). Placing an object within the electric field of a capacitor will affect the capacitance value and the corresponding time constant. See the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RC_time_constant\">RC time constant<\/a> entry on Wikipedia for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>We hope you appreciate the cleverness of this project as much as we did and how relatively easy it is to get a very 21st century interface (however crude) out of some aluminum foil and a cardboard box! We'd love to hear of your experiences with the build (in the comment section below).<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"Weekend Project","flagid":"GUIDE_SPONSOR_RADIO_SHACK","text":"This project is part of RadioShack's The Great Create."}],"guideid":2233,"image":{"imageid":46566,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/LNr1tjTZTTvni2pj"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ikD_3Vemkf0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>In this project, we'll take a very simple idea -- the length of time it takes a capacitor to charge -- and make something rather amazing with it: a 3D interface that can track the position of your hand.
