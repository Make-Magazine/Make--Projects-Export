Of course you could buy these items, but by making your own you end up with something that is exactly right for your particular needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>ABS is very flexible, but a couple of longitudinal bends will make it extremely rigid (comparable to aluminum after it has been formed into a channel or a tube). You can even make bookshelves out of ABS if you add a bend along each of the 2 long edges of a strip. Similarly, you could make a stand for your video monitor, or even a chair, if you\u2019re feeling ambitious. At my workplace, I found that after bending ABS into a channel shape, it was strong enough to support a pair of 20-lb. compressed gas cylinders.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/10\">MAKE Volume 10<\/a>, page 100.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1324,"image":{"imageid":26809,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/pC2gxBRCJOiYBANO"},"introduction":"<p>Last night I dreamed of a magical material that would be bendable like metal, as easy to shape as wood, and would never warp, split, or splinter.

If you\u2019ve ever picked up a Lego block, you\u2019ve handled ABS.

Don\u2019t be surprised if you have to deviate slightly from the lines in the plan. Mostly the plastic stretches around the outside of each bend, but a little shrinkage occurs on the inside too. You lose perhaps 1\/32\" on the inside of a bend in 1\/8\" plastic, although this may vary depending on how hot the plastic is when you bend it. Some trial and error is inevitable.
