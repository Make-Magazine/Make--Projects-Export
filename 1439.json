{"device":"Arduino","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Project\/Kitty+Twitty+Cat+Toy\/1439\/1","guide":{"author":{"text":"Marc de Vinck","userid":11},"categories":["Arduino"],"conclusion":"<h3 id=\"Section_Operation\">Operation<\/h3>\n\n<p>This is really easy. Simply plug in the power supply and Ethernet cable, and flip the switch. The green power LED should come on, and in a few seconds, the blue network status LED, too. The code tweets an \u201cUp and Running\u201d message to let you know everything is OK. You can plug a USB cable into the Arduino and listen in on the serial port for some debugging.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every time the wire makes a connection, you\u2019ll see a new tweet! That\u2019s it!<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Variations\">Variations<\/h3>\n\n<p>You can modify this project to make almost anything send a tweet. It\u2019s a cat toy, but there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be converted into a Twittering dog toy, or even a Twittering bird perch. Just substitute a different kind of switch sensor for the bird-on-a-wire. Make a Twittering burglar alarm? Easy! Doggie door? Sure! Twittering fish? Now that\u2019s a challenge!<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, you can add additional switches or sensors, connect them to as-yet-unused pins on the Arduino, and write some code to handle them. Think about adding a servo to make some random rumbles, or a speaker to simulate a bird. That should keep your cat\u2019s interest!<\/p>\n\n<p>This project is still evolving, and I need to add more parts and experiment with them before I settle on the final Twittering toy. By the time you read this, I hope to have modifications that check whether your cat is sleeping or needs food, via pressure-sensitive piezos under its bed and food bowl. I also plan to add a speaker or small motor to get the cat\u2019s attention.
