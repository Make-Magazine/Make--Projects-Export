My experience with this monochrome projector suggests that getting everything aligned correctly for such a system would be challenging, but certainly not impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I am curious as to the effect that changing the laser color may or may not have on the quality of the image.  As soon as I get my hands on red and\/or blue lasers in an appropriate power range, I will try that experiment and post my results.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[],"guideid":413,"image":{"imageid":6578,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/CoJQglo35vbYrYU1"},"introduction":"<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> The earliest publication of this idea I am now aware of is:<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;Water-drop projector&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>Gorazd Planinsic, Phys.
