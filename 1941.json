It is quite fun to be able to hear bird sounds at the press of a few keys - while coding, designing, or learning! And you can just stare into that pretty LED... ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>We have left the project open-ended, so that you can add more on to it! You can add on some sensors to adjust the sounds, play them automatically, or whatever!<\/p>\n\n<p>This tutorial is part of my fundraising effort for travel expenses to go to Maker Faire Bay Area! I'm trying to answer the question: &quot;How many MAKE Projects does it take to get to Maker Faire?&quot; So if you like this tutorial, you can donate towards my travel expenses <a href=\"http:\/\/robotgrrl.com\/blog\/maker-faire\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>!
