When played back on headphones, the binaural stereoeffect is preserved and is often quite remarkable in its realism. With some easy modifications, a pair of headphones can be turned into a binaural microphone with readily available materials and cheap parts. Better yet, I\u2019ll show you how to make your own binaural mic, disguised as earbuds. In today\u2019s iPod-saturated urban environment, no one ever notices someone wearing headphones. This makes earbuds an ideal prop for covering a hidden mic that\u2019s plugged into a recording device, for various stealthy endeavors.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>A binaural recording system re-creates the way a person actually hears by placing 2 microphones at a distance of about 7&quot; (roughly the distance between your ears), usually mounted on a dummy head or worn on the human recorder\u2019s head.
