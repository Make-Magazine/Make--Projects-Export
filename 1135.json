Lola even helped put the ingredients together \u2014 a little more or less of anything hardly matters. We made an orange batch and a teal batch. One particularly nice quality of a fresh batch is how it\u2019s still warm in the hands. Lola must have spent at least two hours playing with her dough, rolling it out into shapes, and making balls and squares. Maybe next time we\u2019ll try cookie cutters!<\/p>\n\n<p>'''This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craftzine.com\/03\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRAFT Volume 03<\/a>, page 133.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From CRAFT","flagid":"FROM_CRAFT","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of CRAFT or on Craftzine."}],"guideid":1135,"image":{"imageid":22096,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/FSoJtCtorqr1idWm"},"introduction":"<p>Recently, I had fun spending a day with my 2-year-old niece, Lola. At first, a day with a toddler seemed daunting. I tried to remember what I did with my children when they were that age. It started to come back pretty quickly, the need to occupy their young hands and minds with tactile things. Then I remembered my old recipe for play dough that I used to make with my own children. I found it in the metal recipe box between papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and zucchini bread.
