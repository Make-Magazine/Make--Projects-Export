I constantly played with it and within 2 days, the rope was badly frayed.  That shows how quickly rope frays and how much you need our technique.  Frayed rope is difficult to use, but it's quick and easy to repair the damaged ends so you can use the rope again.  It's so easy, I am only ten and (with some help from my dad on step 2) I can do it in under 1 or 2 minutes every time.
