Zinc is of relatively low toxicity, so long as you don't get it so hot that you cause it to burn, in which case inhalation of the zinc oxide smoke can cause &quot;metal fume fever,&quot; which is not the end of the world but should definitely be avoided. It may have long-term health effects and, in any case, can make you feel lousy for a weekend. Zinc melts at 420\u00b0C and burns at 480\u00b0C, so it can be easy to burn it accidentally. You'll know if it happens: Zinc burns with an evil blue green flame, and makes great clouds of smoke. If this should happen to you, don't panic. Being careful not to breathe the smoke, turn off the heat and step back. And as the melt cools take a moment to observe and appreciate the thermochromicit<wbr \/>y of the zinc oxide layer on top: It's bright yellow at high temperatures but will turn back to chalk white as it cools.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next big step up is aluminum. If you have the wherewithal to melt and pour aluminum in your shop, you probably don't need me to tell you how to do it. If you're curious, book one of Dave Gingery's classic 7-book DIY-machine-shop series is solely dedicated to the construction and operation of an ultra-low-cost home aluminum foundry. I have only attempted this paper pattern process with lead, but I don't see why it couldn't also work with hotter melts like zinc or aluminum. If you try it do let me know how it goes.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"pyramid_puzzle_pattern.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/5LdNKscovPkIoFDp.pdf","documentid":72}],"flags":[],"guideid":396,"image":{"imageid":6425,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/UvfbUKsAQW3TcS24"},"introduction":"<p>This project began when I read the following entry [#274] in Volume 1 of Popular Mechanics' 1913 <em>The Boy Mechanic<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<p>The round lead weight for shot-putting or hammer throwing can be cast in a hollow cardboard or pressed-paper ball, sold in department and toy stores for 10 cents.
