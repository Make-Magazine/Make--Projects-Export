I will demonstrate how to download and install the C language compiler for the Trakr. Next, I\u2019ll explain how to compile a simple program and install it on the Trakr and then run this simple program. Then I will demonstrate how to open up the Trakr, attach jumper pins to the GPIO connections on the circuit board of the Trakr. With the jumper pins installed I'll show you how to tap into the 9 volt power supply of the Trakr and make connection cables to connect to Snap Circuits and the Lego motor. The Lego grabber arm will need to be mounted on the Trakr, so I'll show you how to attach a payload deck made out of Legos. Finally, I'll provide you with the C language code that you can compile and install on the Trakr to operate the remote controlled grabber bot.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>In this Make:Project I will demonstrate how to use Legos, Snap Circuits, and the Spy Video Trakr to create a remote controlled grabber bot.
