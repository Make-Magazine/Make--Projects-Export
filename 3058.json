It won\u2019t break as long as the stresses stay under a certain limit.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trick to making the wood flexible is to break it up in a lot of small pieces that can all twist a little. All these tiny twists add up so you can bend the sheet without stressing the material too much.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine it like this: when you twist a matchstick with your hands, you can twist it maybe 1\/8 of a turn before it breaks. Imagine now you have a matchstick 10 times longer. You can twist it 10 times as far, more than a full turn. That\u2019s how the hinge we use here works. When you look closely you can see that the cuts leave a pattern of interconnected small \u201csticks.\u201d When you bend the cover, you\u2019ll see them all twisting a little bit.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are several patterns that will allow bending. The simplest one is a set of shifted cuts.The longer or wider you make the piece, the softer it gets. This pattern yields a very springy hinge that you can move in all directions.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make the hinge stronger, you can add some tabs in each line. This gives the hinge a lot more strength while still allowing you to bend it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inside the cover is a clamp that holds the notepad with two flexible \u201carms,\u201d cut so they're slightly smaller than the notepad.
