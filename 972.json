In about 15 minutes you can set up your own laser communication system using a cheap laser pointer and a few parts from RadioShack. The audio signal from a microphone varies the power feeding the laser, so that its brightness changes, following the shape of the original sound wave. At the receiving end, a solar cell or photo-resistor converts the oscillating light signal back into the original sound.</p>\n\n<p>The communication is completely private, with no wire connection to tap into. Only you will be able hear what comes over the secret laser link.</p>\n\n<p>Check out more <a href=\"http://makeprojects.com/Info/Weekend_Projects\">Weekend Projects</a>.</p>",
