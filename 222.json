This bolt is one such item.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s made from an ordinary steel bolt that\u2019s hollowed out and fitted with a threaded, removable head. If made to the correct size and properly painted, it could replace a solid bolt on a fence, bridge, or similar structure. (Of course, we don\u2019t advocate that you remove a real bolt from a bridge! The device described here should be considered a desktop curiosity only.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A Bit About Bolts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The bolt for this project can be of many sizes. For ease of machining, it should be SAE Grade 1 or 2 steel; both are low-carbon and not heat-treated.<\/p>\n\n<p>The head of the bolt tells the grade by a series of radial hash marks. No hash marks at all indicates the lowest grade, and therefore the softest and easiest to machine. Select a bolt that has a portion of its shank unthreaded (a long length-to-diameter ratio) which will leave a section available for the new threads.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this project, I chose a \u00bd-13\u00d72&quot; bolt.
