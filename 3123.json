After you learn the basics, mount your pinhole camera on a rigid tripod and try making portraits of perfectly still friends and relatives. Make a time exposure of the movement of the stars across the night sky. Or mount a pinhole on a light-tight extension tube to make a telephoto pinhole. Once you start making pinhole images, you\u2019ll soon think of many other ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.makezine.com\/volume\/make-33\">Make Magazine Volume 33<\/a>, page 104.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."},{"title":"Featured Guide","flagid":"GUIDE_STARRED","text":"This project has been found to be exceptionally cool by the MAKE staff."}],"guideid":3123,"image":{"imageid":56511,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/2s6HOsAKFJdcI2JW"},"introduction":"<p>Long before the digital photography era, I enjoyed making photographs with a 35mm film camera equipped with a pinhole instead of a lens.
