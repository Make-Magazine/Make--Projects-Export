It\u2019s portable, so you can carry or wheel it to a water source, and if you wash with biodegradable soap, the wash water can easily go to a garden afterward.<\/p>\n\n<p>They\u2019re now using the washer in Hyanja, Nepal, where I collaborated on designing a localized version. It\u2019s also a neat design if you\u2019re living off the grid by choice in an industrialized area, or just conserving water and power.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inciting Agitation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The washer consists of 3 main components: a container, a net bag, and a lever-driven shaft mechanism held in place by a simple wooden frame.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key component is the net bag, which is designed to hold, squeeze, and agitate the clothes. The middle of the net bag is a wide, open cylinder of flexible mesh netting. End-capping the cylinder above and below are semi-rigid cones made from short plastic pipes strung together with rope.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both cones point upward, so the bottom cone sticks up through the clothes and prevents them from balling together.<\/p>\n\n<p>While the washer is in operation, the top cone holds fast while the bottom cone is pulled up and down by the shaft, carrying the clothes with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each pump of the lever handle pulls the clothes up out of the water, squeezes them out between the nested cones, and releases them back down. The lever\u2019s 40&quot; length provides mechanical advantage for easy operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>These instructions show how to build a bare-bones device for less than $50 using materials from any home supply store. You can modify the design to suit available materials and your skill level. A machine of this size can handle only small loads up to 5lbs, but the ones we made in Nepal were larger, and I think that one could be made 2 or 3 times larger and would still be easy to operate.
