This project, the way I did it, used 224 standard toilet paper tubes (4 tiers). Depending on how much t.p. your household goes through in a week, and whether you collect from the neighbors, collecting this many tubes could take a short or very long time. It took me about 6 months before I had enough (I built it a little at a time, so I had this thing in the corner that slowly grew...), but that's because 1) I wasn't diligent enough and didn't collect every single tube that I could have, 2) I only accepted tubes that were perfect, no squashed or damp tubes, and 3) I didn't ask the neighbors, because they use a different brand of t.p. Speaking of which, the <em>Style<\/em> in which you do your crafts, affects tube collection a great deal. If I had collected all tubes from all possible sources, I probably would have completed the project within a month. However, I want the t.p.-tube-origin of this table to be a great clever secret, so I need it to be as perfect in appearance as possible, and as leveled and symmetrical as cardboard can be. I discovered that if you put tubes of different brands side by side, there will be up to a 1\/4 inch difference in height. Since I wanted the parts of my table to be perfectly flat and make good contact with the glue, I stuck to just one brand of cardboard tubes. So again, you can be more or less precise with this project as you like.
