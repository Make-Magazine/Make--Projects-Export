How about trying two straws?  Why not make a larger Lego car and use a larger balloon?  Use your imagination.  Some people think that the reason the car moves forward is because of the air coming out of the straw.  Try this experiment, either as an actual experiment or as a thought experiment.   Use a large balloon and a 6 foot long piece of 1\/4&quot; plastic hose instead of a straw.  After blowing up the balloon pinch the hose right where the hose and balloon join.  Put the car down on the floor and let go of the hose.  Will the car start moving the instant you let go of the hose or will it sit there until the air comes out of the balloon?  What do you think? If you try it out please keep in mind that there is such a thing as inertia...<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":3347,"image":{"imageid":58527,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/WP3bUshM3mmIcYtp"},"introduction":"<p>This toy car, made with LEGOS and powered by a blown-up balloon, is super simple and fun to make and fun to play with.
