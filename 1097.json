My solution was The Charge Box, a simple circuit with four separate AC circuits that allow for charging up to four devices simultaneously.  The sockets and wires are all neatly tucked in the box with only the device connection showing.  Each circuit is independently controlled by a toggle switch, so no current is drawn unless a device is being charged.  A lighted master switch controls all circuits and provides a visual indication when power is applied t the box.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I got tired of always tripping over cords dangling from a wall socket or trying to separate one cord from a tangled mess in a drawer every time I charged my phone ( other devices).
