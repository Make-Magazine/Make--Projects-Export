The simplest pulsejet is the Reynst combustor, which uses one opening for both air intake and exhaust. The pioneering Swiss jet engineer Francois Reynst discovered this combustor as a pyromaniac child. He perforated the lid of a glass jar, put a small amount of alcohol inside, and lit the top. Flames shot out of the hole and then were sucked back into the bottle before being ejected again. This almost-magical process repeated until all of the fuel was expended. Reynst had discovered a jar that literally breathed fire, like St. George\u2019s dragon.
