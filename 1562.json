A lot can be done with spray paint and fabric to create a color-textured material for versatile use.

After he could run no more, he came to the edge of a forest and began to climb a tree to reach safety.  When he ascended, it was with fluidity and seemed natural.  He climbed until he reached a point several feet up and became still, hanging effortlessly on the trunk of the tree.  When he turned his head to face his pursuer, his head was that of a lizard, his hands and feet closely following suit in their transformation.  As he stared, his big yellow eyes began to glow - he had eluded danger.<\/p>\n\n<p>The visual composition of the dream interested me and I decided to make a mask to turn myself into the Business Lizard for Halloween.
