Turn the crank smoothly at a moderate speed. The electrodes should produce a thin blue spark. Look closely and you\u2019ll notice that one end is brighter; this is your positive electrode.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stop cranking and engage the Leyden jars. These can hold a charge for days. From this point on, consider the machine \u201chot\u201d until you short the electrodes by simultaneously touching both with the tip of a screwdriver. Also be warned that Leyden jars can acquire charge just sitting there, so you need to discharge them this way each and every time before you touch the electrodes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Turn the crank again. After several revolutions you\u2019ll hear the neutralizing brushes crackle, you\u2019ll smell the fresh scent of ozone, and \u2014 CRACK! \u2014 a strong blue spark will jump the gap.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Adjustments\">Adjustments<\/h3>\n\n<p>Short the electrodes and reposition them a little farther apart. Crank some more and you\u2019ll see a bigger spark. Repeat this procedure until you see multiple small sparks jump from one of the collectors, across several sectors, to a neutralizing brush. You\u2019ve reached your maximum spark length.<\/p>\n\n<p>After you find the maximum gap, you can adjust the neutralizing bars. Narrowing their angle from 90\u00b0 to about 60\u00b0 will increase the maximum voltage at the expense of a small decrease in current.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Maintenance\">Maintenance<\/h3>\n\n<p>Your machine should require little maintenance, but may require periodic replacement of the belts and cleaning of the disks. Use only water to clean them, or rubbing alcohol if you suspect there is oil on them.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_The_Electric_Kiss_and_Other_Entertaiments\">The Electric Kiss (and Other Entertaiments)<\/h3>\n\n<p>Wimshurst machines had a place in Victorian entertainment. After a fine meal, guests might adjourn to the parlor for games, discussion, and scientific demonstrations. One can imagine the visceral impact of the Wimshurst machine, with its spinning glass disks, electrical discharges, and the loud report of 6&quot; sparks.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the adventurous, in the right company, there was a demonstration known as the electric kiss. Two volunteers would stand on insulating surfaces. Each would touch one of the 2 charge collectors and then they\u2019d slowly, without any other part of their bodies touching, bring their lips together for the inevitable \u201ctingle\u201d of electricity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CAUTION:<\/strong> Demonstrate the electric kiss only with the Leyden jars taken out of the circuit, to avoid a painful jolt.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Further_Reading\">Further Reading<\/h3>\n\n<p>Ford, R.A., Homemade Lightning: Creative Experiments in Electricity, 2001<\/p>\n\n<p>Francis, G.W., Electrostatic Experiments: An Encyclopedia of Early Electrostatic Experiments, Demonstrations, Devices, and Apparatus, 2005<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>See the Wimshurst machine in action<\/strong>  on Make: television, Episode 103, at <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.tv\/episodes\" rel=\"nofollow\">makezine.tv\/episodes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/17\">MAKE Volume 17<\/a>, page 94.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"Wimshurst_sidebar.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/vTuy5VuxgchieF11.pdf","documentid":201}],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1267,"image":{"imageid":24898,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/urK2e5CnmTKfXiYQ"},"introduction":"<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/2644322?portrait=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n<p>When assembling a proper laboratory, the gentleman or lady experimenter should be sure to include a Wimshurst electrostatic generating machine.

This machine, or more specifically the Leyden jars that are a part of it, are capable of delivering shocks in excess of 50,000 volts. While the current is quite low and therefore unlikely to harm a healthy person, a serious jolt might knock you off your feet \u2014 and who knows what your head will hit on the way down. Please be careful and treat all sources of high voltage electricity with the utmost respect.","bullet":"icon_caution","level":0}],"object":null,"images":[{"imageid":24872,"orderby":1,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/6f2vF3YmXYFtGq2A"}],"number":22}],"subject":"","summary":"Make sparks in your parlor.","time_required":"2 weekends","title":"The Wimshurst Influence Machine","tools":[{"text":"Carpenter&apos;s square","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Carpenter%27s_square","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Drawing compass","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Drawing_compass","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Epoxy","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/www.radioshack.com\/product\/index.jsp?productId=11776438","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Hacksaw","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Hacksaw","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Hobby knife","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/www.radioshack.com\/product\/index.jsp?productId=12710568","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Metal files","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Metal_files","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Miscellaneous screwdrivers","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Miscellaneous_screwdrivers","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Power Drill","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Power_Drill","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Sandpaper","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Sandpaper","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Screw tap","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/makeprojects.com\/Item\/Screw_tap","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Solder","notes":"","url":"http:\/\/www.radioshack.com\/product\/index.jsp?productId=2062719","thumbnail":""},{"text":"Soldering torch","notes":"I use a Lenk LSP-180 torch.
