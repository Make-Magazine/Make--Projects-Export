One of my early projects was a Morse Code Telegraph.  Of course this project needed a switch to send out the code.  I came up with the Popsicle Stick switch since it could be easily made from a Popsicle Stick (a regular craft stick also works fine) and a couple of screws. This I thought would be great for kids to make themselves since in making it they would learn the basic principles of an electric switch. In addition to having a nice sound to its name, the switch worked out better than I hoped.  I have used it  in numerous other projects, including my Wireless Telegraph, Popsicle Stick Electronic Organ, Solar Powered Flashlight, Electric Buzzer, Reaction Timer Game, Game Timer and more.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"videoBox_center\" style=\"width:592px;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7y_tyhbGnaI?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>","introduction_rendered":"<p>I have been Workshop Editor for both <em>Boys' Quest <\/em>and <em>Fun For Kidz<\/em> magazine for over 15 years.
