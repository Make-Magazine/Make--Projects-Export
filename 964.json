If you rush it, the cat will get uncomfortable and may reject the entire process permanently.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Don\u2019t try to force the cat to do anything it doesn\u2019t want to do \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t have to pick it up and put it in the litter box, for example. If the cat\u2019s not figuring it out, use a treat to tempt it into modeling the correct behavior, and if it resists (or behaves for the treat but not on its own) you\u2019ve moved too quickly from one stage to the next. Go back a step or two and proceed more slowly.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Indoor\/outdoor cats are likely to hold it while inside and wait until they can go out, which can lead to urinary tract infections. If they don\u2019t take to the training right away, give it up. (See warnings below.)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>It helps if you\u2019re around to be available for training. If you\u2019re at the office 12 hours a day, your cat will make its own solution for relieving itself.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Flushing after the cat uses the toilet can help.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>Once the cat is successfully using the system, reward it with treats after each success to reinforce the behavior. This is particularly handy from stage 4 on.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>A Word of Warning<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a few big issues to keep in mind when deciding whether to try to toilet-train your cat:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00bb Don\u2019t teach your cat to flush. Once it learns, it will find this an entertaining way to pass the time and your water bill will skyrocket.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00bb Don\u2019t toilet-train if you live near a body of water where river or sea otters live. Cat feces can contain a protozoan called Toxoplasma gondii that is known to kill otters.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00bb This is the big one: If your cat isn\u2019t taking to the toilet within a month\u2019s time, quit trying (at least for a few months). Domestic cats are very prone to urinary tract infections, which can kill them if left untreated. Most often these occur when a cat is holding its urine, which it\u2019s likely to do if stressed or uncomfortable with its toilet situation. Your cat may simply not be a good candidate for using the toilet, in which case it\u2019s better to let the cat have its way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Signs of urinary tract infection include (but are not limited to):<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>urinating in inappropriate places <\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>crying in the litter box<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>frequent urination in tiny amounts<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>straining to urinate<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>bloody urine<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li>excessive genital licking<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>If you observe any of these signs, see your vet immediately.<\/p>\n\n<p>''This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makezine.com\/20\">MAKE Volume 20<\/a>, page 144.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":964,"image":{"imageid":17234,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/HOlYmWvVxTQJcIUf"},"introduction":"<p>Would you let your guests crap in a box on your floor? No? Then why would you let your cats? Here\u2019s how to get them using the toilet like civilized members of the family.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aside from the risks of toxoplasmosis and other diseases transmitted by cat feces, there\u2019s significant labor for the owner involved in maintaining a litter box. Being inherently lazy, I decided it would be easier to just toilet-train the cat.

One issue many cats have is that squatting on the toilet seat (not the lid) is a slippery, sloped, and narrow proposition. If your cat is at all standoffish about this (mine sure was), then this system ought to work better. As an added advantage, this system allows you to put the lid down so you don\u2019t sit on whatever your cat has tracked in on their paws.
