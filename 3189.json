I decided to build miniature photo lights from small, efficient LEDs.<\/p>\n\n<p>On eBay I found complete LED reflector bulbs for just $3 each. They are plug-compatible and identical in size and packaging to the little 12V quartz-halogen spotlights often used in track lighting (although the LEDs have a cooler light temperature of 6,000 Kelvin--very similar to cloudy daylight). All the distributors were in China, but I've never had any problems ordering components from Chinese sources. Sure enough, within 10 days I received my lights.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since each unit was rated at 4W, I needed a 12VDC AC adapter rated to supply at least 40W. Fortunately this kind of switching power supply is commonly available as a power source for laptops and LED displays. I found a 50W unit for $5.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Caution: Some adapters of this kind deliver much more than 12VDC when they are not fully loaded. Therefore, avoid powering just one light at a time.)<\/p>\n\n<p>How to mount the lights? I wanted to use them in two sets of five, so that I could position each set on opposite sides of a subject. The angle of each individual light had to be adjustable, so that I could focus their combined beams around a small object, or point them at a larger object from farther away. I also wanted to be able to angle the lights up and down, or backward toward a reflective photographic umbrella if I needed diffuse, shadowless illumination.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design that I came up with uses jointed arms, made from 3\/4&quot; oak and small aluminum angle brackets. Originally, the lights push-fitted onto a 3\/8&quot; brass peg. I later changed the design so that they screwed onto a \u00bc-20 threaded stud, which is a more common termination on a photographic light stand (plus it fits on a tripod). If you don't have light stands or extra tripods, you can easily improvise something from a vertical 1&quot; dowel screwed into a plywood base.<\/p>\n\n<p>I chose oak as my construction material because I wanted to use wood screws to make the joints in the articulated arms.
