(My wife is baking the wedding cake.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9 a.m.<\/strong> I\u2019m now worried; I haven\u2019t made progress on anything, and from reading the book I\u2019m estimating a 6- or 7-hour cooking time with a 5 p.m. eating target. Mose arrives. Sigh of relief.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:05<\/strong> We get the fire started in the 2 fire pans. We have enough old eucalyptus logs to cook a bunch of animals, even though it does consume a surprising amount of wood.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:15<\/strong> Start preparing the animal itself; we decide to figure out how to spin the animal once it\u2019s on the spit.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:20<\/strong> Read hilarious section of River Cottage Meat Book: \u201cLet\u2019s not be delicate here, the pole goes in the a**hole and out the mouth.\u201d Learned that there is indeed nothing delicate about cooking a whole animal.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:25<\/strong> We use too much baling wire and my hands are bleeding, but the lamb is tied to the pole. All I did to prepare the pipe was drill some holes for pushing wire through. You should think a lot more about how to keep the lamb from rolling around. Systems with orthogonal spikes seem very popular.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:45<\/strong> Lamb goes onto the spit above the coals. We\u2019re cooking at last. Seven hours until dinner; if everything goes according to plan we\u2019ll have minutes to spare!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9:55<\/strong> We attempt to drive the spit at a recommended 1\u20133rpm by connecting solar cells through an inverter to produce 12V. There are problems with both the inverter and the drive mechanism.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>10:05<\/strong> Our friction drive made of a BMX bike peg against the bike tire doesn\u2019t work well, and doesn\u2019t give us enough gear reduction. The motor moves about 100rpm, and the friction drive is only about 20:1.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>10:20<\/strong> Switch to using the battery of a 1959 dune buggy. This turns out to be a bad idea but is awfully fun.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>10:30<\/strong> Back to solar panels, and with the arrival of Joe Brock we have a new idea: a capstan drive. Itworks perfectly. Fortunately I have brought a splicing tool and some old kite string that makes an excellent belt. We just wrap a few turns of the string around the motor axle.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>10:40<\/strong> Everything now appears to be working. The lamb is moving at 2\u20133rpm and the only thing to do now is tend the fire. And baste the animal. And drink.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4:40 p.m.<\/strong> Still basting and drinking, but it\u2019s now time to go watch our friends get married. Quickly check the temperature with a meat thermometer: 140\u00b0F deep in the thigh. Perfect.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5:10<\/strong> They\u2019re married! I\u2019m ready to carve. So is Mose. People line up, and it\u2019s done. I can\u2019t believe 75 pounds of animal can disappear so quickly. Sometimes making is solitary, sometimes it's social. Both are beautiful things.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/33\">MAKE Volume 33<\/a>, page 127.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."},{"title":"Featured Guide","flagid":"GUIDE_STARRED","text":"This project has been found to be exceptionally cool by the MAKE staff."}],"guideid":3198,"image":{"imageid":57186,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/1w2CsFHLQRq4K6kI"},"introduction":"<p>Not only do I enjoy making things, I also love making food, so any opportunity that combines both is hard to pass up. Friends of mine were getting married, and being the beautiful and unusual people they are, planned a potluck wedding.

At the local farmer\u2019s market I met the lovely people from Fatted Calf, a San Francisco charcuterie.
