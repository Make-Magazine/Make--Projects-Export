It should be fully cooled and hard. Resin hardens from the inside out, so the surface is the last part to harden. This can take well over a day depending on the mix and conditions. Don\u2019t judge by time; demold only when the surface is hard and no longer tacky. Test hardness using a stick, not your finger.","bullet":"black","level":0},{"text":"You can speed the surface cure by warming the brick under some lights, but be careful not to overheat the casting or the mold.
