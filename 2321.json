It's also free from transfats and industrial additives and is a sustainable product since you're making use of something you'd otherwise throw away.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fats from different animals will have different properties and are useful for different cooking tasks. Duck (or goose) fat is particularly well suited for cooking confit and for frying. Because of its richer flavor it's not well suited for baking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pork fat (lard) and beef fat (tallow) have a more neutral flavor than duck and can be used for baking applications as well as frying, and can be substituted to great advantage in any recipe that calls for shortening.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2321,"image":{"imageid":45826,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/A2BHo1NTUqoAYIOe"},"introduction":"<h3 id=\"Section_Introduction\">Introduction<\/h3>\n\n<p>Instead of throwing away the fat you trim off cuts of meat when cooking you can turn the scraps into a useful ingredient.
