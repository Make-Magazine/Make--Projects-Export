    "conclusion": "<h3 id=\"Section_Backup_Plan\">Backup Plan</h3>\n\n<p>Because Tiny Wanderer has no rear-facing sensor, it might back off a cliff. Strategies for preventing this are a current “area of research” at the DPRG. In the code you downloaded, the robot backs up while turning away from the detected edge, for about 1 second (about 90°). Then it resumes rolling forward. If both sensors find a cliff at the same time (very rare), it backs up straight. Wheel speeds and backup time parameters are easily tweakable in the code’s <em>.h</em> file.</p>\n\n<p>You can also change the robot’s behavior by moving one sensor slightly ahead of the other. Tell Tiny to turn slightly toward the leading sensor when it detects a cliff, then turn sharply when the trailing sensor finds it. That way, Tiny will do a multi-point turn and then pivot to run along the cliff!</p>\n\n<p>Yet another approach is to stop the cliff-side wheel entirely and inch the other wheel forward until both sensors detect the cliff — then back up and turn 180°.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Sensor_Mods_and_Arduino_Upgrade\">Sensor Mods and Arduino Upgrade</h3>\n\n<p>You can reconfigure the Tiny Wanderer sensors to face forward, for object avoidance, or run close together, for line following. Download the code for these behaviors at <a href=\"http://makeprojects.com/v/29\">http://makeprojects.com/v/29</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We designed the Tiny Wanderer as a hackable platform. One possible modification is to add paper encoder disks (black/white stripes) inside the wheels, and use the IR sensors to track servo speed and perform dead reckoning calculations. And of course, you can also use different types of sensors, such as light, sound, or distance.</p>\n\n<p>For a major upgrade of capabilities, the Tiny Wanderer’s deck has mounting holes that fit a standard Arduino board, which has enough I/O pins to support all of the above — not to mention various plug-in shields with amazing capabilities. (I expect many Arduino-heads to be mainly interested in the Tiny Wanderer as an Arduino-scale rolling platform, and dispense with the whole ATtiny brain.)</p>\n\n<p>If you’re ever in Dallas, the DPRG meets every Tuesday night and every second Saturday of the month.
