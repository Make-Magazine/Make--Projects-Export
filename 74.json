A portion of vinegar \u201cmother\u201d can be left in the production vessel after each harvest, and if you continually add more wine to this thriving liquid, the process can go on indefinitely, providing you with homemade vinegar for years to come. All your mother asks for is a little wine.<\/p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll start with the simple science.
