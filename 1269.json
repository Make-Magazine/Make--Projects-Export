Making one is fairly simple, and you can apply all sorts of personal twists to a basic bonnet pattern. I am fond of visiting vintage and thrift stores to search for treasures, and I tend to find myself leaving with an assortment of fabrics and linens. Vintage hankies, hand towels, pillowcases, and napkins are often adorned with hand embroidery - a detail that I love. I began collecting vintage linens before it occurred to me that if properly cut and assembled, these hand-adorned gems could be turned into perfect baby gifts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every bonnet I have made using vintage linens varies greatly. You will not find hand-stitched linens in a standard size or shape, so I recommend really looking at the piece you choose to use and deciding exactly where you want the embroidered embellishments to fall on the hat. Occasionally I come across pieces that are edged in hand-crocheted lace, which I try to incorporate into the portion of the bonnet that shades the face. I have other napkins that have something sewn into the center - with these it might be nice to place the stitching on the back of the hat. The fun part of this project is how you choose to use the embellishments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before beginning, wash all the fabrics you will be using. Be careful with the vintage embroidery: wash it on delicate and cold to avoid bleeding the color from the thread.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to make two variations on this simple bonnet pattern - one with a flat bill and one with a ruffled bill.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>A bonnet is a small, sweet gift for a new baby.
