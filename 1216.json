The sole provides support and cushioning to the foot\u2019s complex structure of bones, joints, muscles, and tendons. Since most shoe companies spend quite a bit of time and money working out issues of construction, materials, and support, we can benefit from their hard work by using existing soles as the platform from which we can build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, almost all shoes are constructed by gluing the upper (the part that covers your foot) to the soles. Once connected, it\u2019s nearly impossible to remove these parts from one another without doing damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if we construct shoes to be modular, then the uppers could be removed from the sole without destroying either part. Straps could be swapped as easily as Lego bricks. In the open source world, developing code in this way allows software developers to distribute a workload in manageable sections. Since the shoe is a complicated object, it will be much easier for us to build if we break the object into discrete elements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because the whole is broken into interchangeable parts, failure in one realm doesn\u2019t bring the whole endeavor down. I experienced this firsthand when I made shoes in the traditional way. I had measured the foot, drafted patterns, cut final materials, sewn them together, and finally glued the upper to the sole.

You simply rebuild the part rather than the whole shoe.<\/p>\n\n<p>By letting companies do the hard stuff for us, we can start making custom shoes much faster and cheaper than if we had to build the whole object. And because we only need to make part of the shoe, we can make custom shoes for less than $20.
