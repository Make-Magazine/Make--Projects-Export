When I decided to get a couple of chickens, I was adamant that the work involved wouldn\u2019t seem like work.

These days it\u2019s all about waking with the sun.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the delightful aspects of chickens is that they\u2019re low-maintenance. As long as they can get out of the coop, grab a bite to eat, have access to fresh water, and retreat to a safe area at night, you basically have very little to do to keep them happy.<\/p>\n\n<p>And seeing as I\u2019m now a lazy, citified man, I wanted a solution that allowed for late mornings, weekend getaways, peace of mind, and avoiding any possible exposure to the elements, either to let the fowl out or collect the eggs. So with a few ideas garnered from around the web, and a few of my own, I cobbled together a henhouse that accomplishes a number of tasks without a single finger lifted, yet provides me with the knowledge that my lovely birds are always out at daybreak, but in at curfew.<\/p>\n\n<p>I created an automated henhouse in my garage with an infrared motion detector, automatic lights, heater, and automated door.
