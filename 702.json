For just a few hours of time spread out over a whole week you can enjoy a unique delicacy that you'll not likely see for sale anywhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be sure to save the rest of the duck I had you take apart; it's all useful and delicious. The breast tenders can be grilled or saut\u00e9ed for a quick snack. The carcass and wings can be roasted and then boiled for stock and you can render the extra fat for a fantastic, trans-fat-free cooking oil. The legs, of course, can be grilled or roasted or, even better, prepared confit. Check back for future guides on all these recipes.<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":702,"image":{"imageid":11520,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/hCaXC3xrSwFiaNpB"},"introduction":"<p>Duck is a wonderful and versatile meat. This simple recipe for curing and drying the breast meat produces a ham remarkably similar to a good prosciutto but only takes about a week. This guide will cover all the steps to cure and dry the ham and some tips on eating it.<\/p>\n\n<p>While this recipe can be made with grocery-store duck, it's best when made using pastured duck from a local farm. When left to their own devices farm ducks have a pretty varied diet and will eat a wide variety of grasses, bugs, minnows, etc., in addition to their feed. This not only contributes to the well-being of the duck, it also greatly improves the flavor and texture of the meat. With a simple dry-cure recipe like this that difference is greatly amplified.<\/p>","introduction_rendered":"<p>Duck is a wonderful and versatile meat.

It's very similar to jointing a chicken. Look for the natural seams\/membranes when removing the breasts and just try to slide your knife in between the seams. The goal is to more-or-less peel the breast off the carcass rather than slice the meat. Take care to leave the skin on. Remove the thighs and drumsticks together; find the joint under the skin and poke your knife point in to sever the tendon, then carefully carve out the leg from the body.
