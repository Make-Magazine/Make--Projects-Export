The biggest change is in the resist coating on the boards. Now it is less sensitive to ambient light. You do not need a safelight or a closed room to work with these new boards. You do have to be careful with direct light from any source for more than a minute or so. You do not need a special bulb to expose them. Sunlight or a fluorescent light works best.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plan your space. I closed my bedroom blinds early in the afternoon and placed the exposer frame under my desk. I put a towel over my bathroom window where I have the development tray filled and set up. That\u2019s it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DATAK Boards use the same developer. They require a Hot 100 \u2013 110 degree water development and a Cold water rinse to fix the resist. They can be exposed with standard 100 watt bulb at 12 inches for about 10 \u2013 15 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing that is important is that the resist is now sensitive to heat. Any heat. Storing a board in its package under direct sunlight will kill your board. Keep them in a cool dark place. Heat is a good thing too. When you are done developing your board you just rinse the board under warm water and that fixes the resist. Caution here. Once the resist is fixed it is not sensitive to the developer or the light anymore. At this point 91% isopropyl alcohol cleans off the resist and you can fix errors or do modifications all in normal light.<\/p>\n\n<p>One downside to these single fluorescent tube exposer frames is that the area of good light is just three inches wide down the length of the tube. A 4x6 board set at the front of the exposer frame will have its back one inch poorly exposed. You must rotate your board. For big boards just move them three inches each step through the exposer. Expose for about 6-8 minutes per step. You can get larger multi-tube exposer frames and special exposer lights.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jameco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jameco<\/a> has everything to make a PCB at home: positive resist boards, positive developer, etchant, trays and an exposer frame.

Then in the PCB remove any rat's nest wires, rotate and move the parts and delete and make new circuit paths. You make big changes in the breadboard view first, then the schematic view if you need it and then the PCB view.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the PCB view deleting a trace is the same as deleting a wire in the breadboard and the schematic views. Complete your changes in the PCB and check for rat's nest wires in the other views. Make wires out of the correct connections and delete the rest. The default PCB is double-sided.
