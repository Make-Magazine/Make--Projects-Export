An additional header file was used to change a float to string. I got the header file from the Arduino playground. I'm sure there is a better way to do it but I couldn't figure it out because I'm new to C++. I also attached a picture of the labview program. The output from the micro-controller to the computer uses a comma to separate the reactivity value and timestamp.<\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[{"text":"Code.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/2KErnf6kseQ2mpeA.pdf","documentid":267},{"text":"floatToString.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/DFPRZc26wLLwBfQD.pdf","documentid":268},{"text":"Labview-program.pdf","url":"http:\/\/make-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/LdaiDG4S46mVX6j5.pdf","documentid":269}],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2116,"image":{"imageid":42128,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/sbLXF4TGGJxHIUAJ"},"introduction":"<p>Inverse-kinetics is an equation that will calculate the reactivity value for the reactor (in terms of cents).
