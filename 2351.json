There are various sources for it online, but the only major walk-in retailer that I could find who carries it is Walmart. Try your local craft store as well; the craft company Darice makes liquid starch. I tried some of this also and it, too, made good slime.<\/p>\n\n<p>Credit for this slime recipe goes to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencebob.com\/experiments\/videos\/video-slime1.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science Bob<\/a>. His website also documents two other recipes for slime:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencebob.com\/experiments\/videos\/video-slime2.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Method 2<\/a> uses borax instead of liquid starch. Borax might be somewhat easier to source; look in the laundry-supplies aisle of grocery stores and similar retailers.  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencebob.com\/experiments\/videos\/video-slime3.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Method 3<\/a> makes transparent slime using borax and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA is extremely hard to find, so Science Bob offers <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencebob.com\/store\/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">kits<\/a>. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>It occurs to me that it might be possible to make slime that glows under UV light by adding Vitamin B<sub>2<\/sub> to the water first (refer to Becky Stern's <a href=\"\/Project\/Kryptonite+Candy\/1631\/1\">Kryptonite Candy guide<\/a>), but I haven't tried this yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Have fun with your slime!<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2351,"image":{"imageid":46392,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/YcERlEngg5DhlUVL"},"introduction":"<p>Need some slime for your next horror film or Halloween haunted house?
