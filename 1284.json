Insulating firebricks, while not necessary, are recommended to hasten the speed of melting the aluminum and to keep propane prices down.<\/p>\n\n<p>You'll need something to put these firebricks and refractory in, of course. I used an old 14 gallon air receiver I had lying around, but a similarly sized steel tank of any sort should work. You'll also need to build a scaffolding to support the tang, something to use as hinges, and a burner, propane tank and hose. Another thing you'll need is something to catch and hold the liquid aluminum; I used a stainless steel bucket with a long handle built in to keep it far away from the operator.
