The fish-eye lens is about 1\/4&quot; deeper than the other two. Because the lenses have a magnetic ring in their base (used to attach them to the phone), they adhere naturally to the tin case. But because two of the lenses are shorter, I've added a small piece of sheet foam (available at any craft store), secured with double-sided carpet tape. This helps keep the lens caps secured in place.","text_raw":"Here's the case opened.

The only thing I found that works (and it works VERY well) is the kind of clear epoxy that comes in liquid form, in a dual-chamber syringe.
