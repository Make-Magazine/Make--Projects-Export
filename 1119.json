Here are some suggestions:<\/p>\n\n<ol><li>No counting at power-up. It would be nice if the circuit begins in its \u201cready\u201d state, rather than already counting. To achieve this you need to send a negative pulse to pin 2 of IC6, and maybe a positive pulse to pin 15 of IC1. Maybe an extra 555 timer could do this. I\u2019m going to leave you to experiment with it.<\/li><li>Audible feedback when pressing the Start button. Currently, there\u2019s no confirmation that the Start button has done anything. All you need to do is buy a piezoelectric beeper and wire it between the right-hand side of the Start button and the positive side of the power supply.<\/li><li>A random delay interval before the count begins. Making electronic components behave randomly is very difficult, but one way to do it would be to require the user to hold his finger on a couple of metal contacts. The skin resistance of the finger would substitute for R11. Because the finger pressure wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same each time, the delay would vary. You\u2019d have to adjust the value of C5.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Summing_Up\">Summing Up<\/h3>\n\n<p>This project demonstrated how a counter chip can be controlled, how counter chips can be chained together, and three different functions for 555 timers. It also showed you how chips can communicate with each other, and introduced you to the business of calibrating a circuit after you\u2019ve finished building it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Naturally, if you want to get some practical use from the circuit, you should build it into an enclosure with heavier-duty pushbuttons \u2014 especially the button that stops the count. You\u2019ll find that when people\u2019s reflexes are being tested, they are liable to hit the Stop button quite hard.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/21\">MAKE Volume 21<\/a>, page 96.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":1119,"image":{"imageid":22099,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/BcPiyQiPqZK1J1Hf"},"introduction":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=9780596153748\">Make: Electronics<\/a> is an electronics primer for the early 21st century.
