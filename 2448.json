Sir Isaac Newton, who was one of the greatest scientists that ever lived, stated that liquids flow at predictable rates. Oobleck is just the opposite! For instance, if you have water, which is a Newtonian liquid, in a water pistol and you push the trigger slowly the water doesn't reach a very long distance. It you apply 2 times more pressure to the trigger, the water should go twice as far!<\/p>\n\n<p>Oobleck is just the opposite. When you apply more force the goo turns &quot;solid&quot;. It acts like this because it is a suspension, meaning the cornstarch is not dissolved. If the concoction sat for long enough the cornstarch would settle to the bottom of the container.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed the experiment as much as my classmates and I did!<\/p>","difficulty":"Easy","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"User-Contributed Project","flagid":"GUIDE_USER_CONTRIBUTED","text":"This project guide is not managed by MAKE staff."}],"guideid":2448,"image":{"imageid":47661,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/ooEqSxKoCP1RbVY6"},"introduction":"<p>Not only is this a fun and messy experiment, it's also a great way to learn about science!
