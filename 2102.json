But also incredibly dangerous. This circuit creates so many ions that everything else becomes charged. Be careful or you may zap your chips through excess charge or you'll shock yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you touch the high voltage wires you will most likely die. ONLY BUILD WITH FRIENDS (So they can call 9-1-1 when your heart stops) WITH SEASONED ENGINEERS\/VETER<wbr \/>ANS, AND ABOVE ALL ELSE JUST BE SAFE.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are smart about this project it is no more dangerous then mains electricity.
