You\u2019ll get the biggest sparks by holding the back of your hand flat alongside the can, and if you point a finger near it in the dark, you may see the air glow blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tape threads or tissue paper strips to the can; they should spread out and repel each other. Tape a bent paper clip or wire to the can, and instead of building up a charge, the end of the wire will create a small wind of ions. Blow bubbles or drop confetti near your generator and watch what happens.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Section_Troubleshooting_and_Adjustments\">Troubleshooting and Adjustments<\/h3>\n\n<p>Humid environments inhibit the triboelectric effect. Test-rub a balloon or a fleece blanket on your head; if it doesn\u2019t generate static, it\u2019s too humid. You may be able to get your Van de Graaff generator to work after blowing hot air through it with a hair dryer.<\/p>\n\n<p>If it still isn\u2019t working, remove the can and go back over Step 9 (assembly), checking the brushes and belt. Also try cleaning the rollers or replacing the rubber band. All working surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of oil.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once the generator works well, cover the rim of the can with electrical tape and attach it to the coupling. Covering the can-opener marks increases the maximum charge.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eventually, the Van de Graaff generator will attract dust, reducing its effectiveness. Wipe the dust off with a dry cloth to return the generator to peak ability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This project first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/28\">MAKE Volume 28<\/a>, page 124.<\/strong><\/p>","difficulty":"Moderate","documents":[],"flags":[{"title":"From MAKE Magazine","flagid":"FROM_MAKE","text":"This project first appeared on the pages of MAKE magazine."}],"guideid":2072,"image":{"imageid":41556,"text":"http:\/\/guide-images.makeprojects.org\/igi\/w3ZSixVEZgJcoVxZ"},"introduction":"<p>When I was younger, I spent hours perusing Bill Beaty\u2019s electrostatics web pages.
