Not only does it shout to the world that you have rocking sewing skills, it also shows that you rock, be it as a genuine or wannabe rock star.<\/p>\n\n<p>With an endless array of colors to choose from, you can even express what kind of music you\u2019re into. Whether you\u2019re a punk princess or a hardcore metal artist, you can sport this bag and be the envy of everyone.
