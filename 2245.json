The designs I found were typically of the cardboard-and-foam variety; nice enough to look at, but too flimsy to last for longer than a single costume party. I wanted something that would have more heft and look more realistic, even if I'm only going to be swinging it around the house. I didn't find many designs that fit the bill, but I do have to give a shout-out to the prop-maker Blind Squirrel, who has a nice description of his hammer here: <a href=\"http:\/\/blindsquirrelprops.blogspot.com\/2006\/03\/thor-hammer-mjolnir.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http:\/\/blindsquirrelprops.blogspot.com\/2006\/03\/thor-hammer-mjolnir.html\">http:\/\/blindsquirrelprops.blogspot.com\/2...<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>For my own Mj\u00f6lnir, I tried to compromise between fidelity to the film prop and ease of construction. My finished product is different from the film version in a few ways. It's less decorated and has a carved wood handle rather than a leather-wrapped design. I also changed the proportions a bit. The film prop hammer is a bit more square where mine is rectangular, but this design allows the hammerhead to be constructed out of simple pieces of 2x4.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm providing specific measurements here, but this project is easy to modify. You can change the size or proportions of the hammer to suit you.
